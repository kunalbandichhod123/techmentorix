**Team ThreeBits working on Aarogyam (Healthcare Assistant).**

### Problem Statement:
> 🔴 **Limited Access:** Patients in remote areas struggle to access timely medical advice and prescriptions.
> 🔴 **Inefficient Triaging:** Doctors spend valuable time on basic queries instead of critical cases.
> 🔴 **Language Barriers:** Medical interfaces are often not localized, making it hard for non-English speakers.
> 🔴 **Record Management:** Physical reports are easily lost; there is a need for digital, secure, and accessible history.

### 💡 Proposed Solution:
> An AI-powered, voice-enabled healthcare assistant that bridges the gap between patients and medical resources.

#### 1] 🧠 Intelligent Voice Assistant (My Module)
> * **Natural Language Processing:** Understands patient symptoms in multiple languages (Hindi/English).
> * **Symptom Analysis:** Uses trained ML models to suggest potential diagnosis and precautions.
> * **Hands-Free:** Completely voice-operated for ease of use by elderly or differently-abled patients.

#### 2] 💻 Smart Dashboard & PDF Generation (Teammate 1)
> * **Dynamic Reports:** Automatically generates a PDF prescription/report based on the AI's analysis.
> * **Doctor's Portal:** Allows medical professionals to view patient history and override AI suggestions.

#### 3] 🎨 User-Friendly UI/UX (Teammate 2)
> * **Accessible Design:** High contrast, large buttons, and intuitive navigation for all age groups.
> * **Real-time Feedback:** Visual indicators for voice recording and processing status.
