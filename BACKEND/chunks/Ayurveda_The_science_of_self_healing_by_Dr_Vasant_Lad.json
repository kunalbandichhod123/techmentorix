    "text": "PREFACE he author's inspiration for this book grew out of a strong belief that Ayurveda should be shared with Westerners in a simple. practical way. Heretofore, Ayurveda has been viewed in the West as an esoteric science. Yet it is a simple, prac- tical science of life whose principles are universally applicable to each individual's daily existence. Ayurveda speaks to every ele- ment and facet of human life, offering guidance that has been tested and refined over many centuries to all those who seek greater harmony and peace and longevity. The knowledge supplied in this book will be of lasting value to the reader. The science of Ayurveda is based not on constantly changing research data, but on the eternal wisdom of the rishis who received this science, expressive of the perfect wholeness of Cosmic Con- sciousness, through religious introspection and meditation. Ayur- veda is a timeless science and the reflection and elucidation here. it is hoped, will serve the reader throughout his or her life. Ayurveda is concerned with eight principle branches of medi- cine: pediatrics, gynecology, obstetrics, opthalmology, geriatrics, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), general medicine and surgery. Each of these medical specialties is addressed according to theories of the five elements (Ether, Air, Fire, Water, Earth); the tridosha, or three bodily humors; the seven dhatus, or body tissues: three malas (urine, stools, sweat): and the trinity.of tife: body. mind and spiritual awareness. These concepts are fully elucidated in this introductory text. This book is mainly concerned with presenting a basic over- view of Ayurveda, including techniques of examination, diagnosis and treatment: promotion of longevity: the use of herbal remedies and other practical everyday aspects of maintaining health.",

The writings of Sushruta impressively anticipated much of modern medicine. He treated in detail, among other topics, post- mortem dissection and plastic surgery procedures which. centuries later, were used as the basis for modern plastic surgery. Sushruta perfected techniques for knitting broken bones with nails; he iden- tified vital points on the body, marmas, which are related to the vital organs. External trauma to these points may be extremely serious or fatal. Among his other numerous contributions, Sushruta also devised a special treatment of bloodletting to cure blood-born disorders. It should be obvious, from this brief highlighting, that we have much to learn from the ancient Ayurvedic masters. The wisdom of Ayurveda is recorded in Sanskrit, the ancient language of India.

    "text": "Chapter | History and Philosophy * yurveda encompasses not only science but religion and philosophy as well. We use the word religion to denote be- liefs and disciplines conducive toward states of being in which the doors of perception open to all aspects of life. In Ayurveda, the whole of life's journey is considered to be sacred. The word philosophy refers to love of truth and in Ayurveda, truth is Being, Pure Existence, The Source of all life. Ayurveda is a science of truth as it is expressed in life. All Ayurvedic literature is based on the Samkhya philosophy of creation. (The roots of the term Samkhya are two Sanskrit words: sat, meaning ‘truth,’ and khya, meaning to:know.’’) The reader is asked to cultivate an open mind and heart toward the philosophy of Samkhya because of its intimate connection with Ayurveda. The ancient realized beings. rishis, or seers of truth. discovered truth by means pf. religious practices and disciplines. Through in- tensive meditation, they manifested truth in their daily lives. Ayurveda is the science vof daily living and this system of knowledge evolved from the rishis’ practical, philosophical and religious illumination, which was rooted in their understanding of the creation. They perceived, in the close relationship.between man and the universe, how cosmic energy manifests in all living and nonliving things. They also realized that the source of all existence is Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy — Shiva and Shakti. The rishi Kapila, who realized the Samkhya philosophy of crea- tion, discovered twenty-four principles or elements of the universe,* * * This chapter, which may be difficult for readers who have no prior knowledge of the subjects discussed, may be read first. last or at any point that is comfortable.",

They also realized that the source of all existence is Cosmic Consciousness, which manifests as male and female energy — Shiva and Shakti. The rishi Kapila, who realized the Samkhya philosophy of crea- tion, discovered twenty-four principles or elements of the universe,* * * This chapter, which may be difficult for readers who have no prior knowledge of the subjects discussed, may be read first. last or at any point that is comfortable. **The specific 24 principles or elements in the Samkhya philosophy are the following: Prakruti; Mahad, Ahamkar: Five Sense Faculties; Five Motor Organs; Mind; Five Senses, i.e..",

Purusha is formless, colorless and beyond attributes and takes no active part in the manifestation of the universe. This energy is choiceless, passive awareness. Prakruti has form, color and attributes: it is awareness with choice. It is Divine Will, the One who desires to become many. The universe is the child born out of the womb of Prakruti, the Divine Mother. Prakruti creates all forms in the universe, while Purusha is the wit- ness to this creation. It is primordial physical energy containing the three attributes, or gunas, found in all nature, the evolving cosmos. The three gunas are satva (essence), rajas (movement) and tamas (inertia). These three are the foundation for all existence. They are contained in balance in Prakruti. When this balance is disturbed, there is an interaction of the gunas which thus engenders the evo- lution of the universe. The first manifestation from Prakruti is Cosmic Intellect. From Mahad, Ego (Ahamkar) is formed. Ego then manifests into the five senses (tanmatras) and the five motor organs, with the help of satva, thus creating the organic universe. The same Ego further manifests into the five basic elements (bhutas) with the help of tamas, to create the inorganic universe. Rajas is the active vital life force in the body which moves both the organic and inorganic universes to satva and tamas, respectively. So satva and tamas are inactive, potential energies which need the active, kinetic force of rajas. Satva is creative potential (Brahma): rajas is a kinetic protective force (Vishnu); and tamas is a potential destructive force (Mahesha).",

    "text": "THE FIRST LIFE SCIENCE Ayurveda is a holistic system of medicine that is indigenous to and widely practiced in India. The word Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term meaning ‘'science of life.” Ayu means “life’’ or “daily living,” and Veda is “knowing.” Ayurveda was first recorded in the Vedas, the world’s oldest extant literature. This healing system has been prac- ticed in daily life in India for more than 5,000 years. AYURVEDA AND HUMAN POTENTIAL Ayurveda teaches that man is a microcosm, a universe within himself. He is a child of the cosmic forces of the external environ- ment, the macrocosm. His individual existenceis indivisible from the total cosmic manifestation. Ayurveda views health and “‘dis- ease” in holistic terms, taking into consideration the inherent rela- tionship between individual and cosmic spirit, individual and cosmic consciousness, energy and matter. According to the teachings of Ayurveda, every human being . has four biological and spiritual instincts: religious, financial, pro- creative and the instinct toward freedom. Balanced good health is the foundation for the fulfillment of these instincts. Ayurveda helps | the healthy person to maintain health, and the diseased person to regain health. It is a medical-metaphysical healing life-science, the mother of all healing arts. The practice of Ayurveda is designed to promote human happiness, health and creative growth. Through studying the teachings of Ayurveda, the practical knowledge of self-healing may be acquired by anyone. By the pro- per balance of all energies in the body, the processes of physical deteriorationand disease can be impressively reduced. This con- cept is basic to Ayurvedic science: the capability of the individual for self-healing. AYURVEDA, YOGA AND TANTRA Ayurveda, Yoga and Tantra are the ancient life-disciplines that have been practiced in India for centuries. They are mentioned in the scriptures of the Vedas and Upanishads.",

Even in modern Western medicine, some concepts are proven to ‘‘work’’ without the reasons behind the phenomena being fully understood; e.g., though antibiotics are used to destroy the bacteria which form toxins in the body, no adequate explana- tion exists to explain how and why toxins are formed from bacteria. Furthermore, Ayurveda is truly a holistic science, one in which the sum of many elements comprises its Truth.Fo question details before a strong overview of the whole science is acquired will prove unproductive and unsatisfactory. The reader is therefore respectfully advised provisionally to accept statements that may at first appear to lack adequate explanation, until he has begun to master the body of Ayurvedic knowledge as a whole.

For thousands of years their teachings were trans- mitted orally from teacher to disciple, and later they were set down in melodious Sanskrit poetry. Though many of these texts have been lost over time, an abundant body off Ayurvedic knowledge survives. Originating in Cosmic Consciousness, this wisdom was in- tuitively received in the hearts of the rishis. They perceived that consciousness was energy manifested into the five basic principles, or elements: Ether (space), Air, Fire. Water and Earth. This concept of the five elements lies at the heart of Ayurvedic science. The rishis perceived that in the beginning the world existed in an unmanifested state of consciousness. From that state of unified consciousness, the subtle vibrations of the cosmic soundless sound aum manifested. From that vibration there first appeared the Ether element. This ethereal element then began to move; its subtle movements created the Air, which is Ether in action. The movement of Ether produced friction, and through that friction heat was generated. Particles of heat-energy combined to form intense light and from this light the Fire element manifested. Thus, Ether manifestedinto Air, and it was the same Ether that further manifested into Fire. Through the heat of the Fire, certain ethereal elements dissolved and liquified, manifesting the Water _element, and then solidified to form the molecules of Earth. In this way, Ether manifested into the four elements of Air, Fire. Water _and Earth. From Earth, all organic living bodies, including those in the vegetable kingdom such as herbs and grains, and those in the animal kingdom, including man, are created.

Latent heat (Fire) in the ice liquifies it, mani- festing the Water principle; and then eventually it turns into steam, expressing the Air principle. The steam disappears‘into Ether, or space. Thus the five basic elements, Ether, Air, Fire, Water and Earth, are present in one substance. All five originated in the energy issuing from Cosmic Consciousness: all five are present in all matter in the universe. Thus,.energy and matter are one. MAN AS MICROCOSM Man is a microcosm of nature and so the five basic elements present in all matter also exist within each individual. In the human body are many spaces which are manifestations of the Ether ele- ment. There are, for example, the spaces in the mouth. nose, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, abdomen, thorax. capil- laries, lymphatics, tissues and cells. Space in movement is called Air. Air is the second cosmic ele- ment, the element of movement. Within the human body, Air manifests in the larger movements of the muscles, the pulsations of the heart, the expansion and contraction of the lungs and the movements of the stomach wall and intestines. Under a microscope, even single cells may be seen to move. Response to a stimulus is the movement of afferent and efferent nerve impulses. which are sensory and: motor movements. The entire movements of the central nervous system are governed by bodily Air. The third element is Fire. The source of Fire and light in the solar system is the sun.

The tridosha are responsible for the arising of natural urges and for individual preferences in foods: their flavors. temperatures and ~ so on. (See Chapter VIII for a description of the mechanics of these preferences.) They govern the creation’ maintenance and destruc- tion of bodily tissue, and the elimination of waste products from the body. They are also responsible for psychological phenomena. including such emotions as fear, anger and greed; and for the highest order of human emotions such as understanding, compas- sion and love. Thus, the tridosha are the foundation of the psychosomatic existence of man. The basic constitution of each individual is determined at con- ception. At the time of fertilization, the single male unit, the sper- matozoon, unites with the single female element, the ovum. At the moment of this union, the constitution of the individual is deter- mined by the permutations and combinations of bodily air, fire and water that manifest in the parents’ bodies.",

    "text": "pitta-kapha. Among these seven general types, there are in- numerable subtle variations that depend upon the percentage of vata-pitta-kapha elements in the constitution. The constitution is called prakruti in Sanskrit, a term meaning “nature,” “creativity” or “the first creation.” In the body, the first expression of the basic five elements is the constitution. The basic constitution of the individual remains unaltered during the lifetime, as it is gene- tically determined. The combination of elements present at birth remains constant. However, the combination of elements that governs the continuous physiopatho- logical changes in the body alters in response to changes in the environment. Throughout life, there is a ceaseless interaction between the internal and external environment. The external environment compris7s the cosmic forces (macrocosm), while the internal forces (microcosm) are governed by the principles of vata-pitta- kapha. A basic principle of healing in Ayurveda holds that one may create balance in the internal forces working in the individual by altering diet and habits of living to counteract changes in his external environment. UNDERSTANDING TRIDOSHA According to Ayurveda, the first requirement for healing oneself and others is a clear understanding of the three dosha, The concept of vata-pitta-kapha is unique to Ayurveda and it holds the potential for revolutionizing the healing systems of the West. How- ever. the concept of the three principles and the Sanskrit words, vata-pitta-kapha, are very difficult to translate into Western terms. Vata is a principle of movement. That which moves is calléd vata. Therefore, vata may be translated as the bodily air principle. ’ However, the element of Air in the external atmosphere is not the same as the air in the body. Bodily air, or vata, may be characterized as the subtle energy that governs biological movement.",

    "text": "Together, the tridosha governs all metabolic activities: anabolism (kapha), catabolism (vata), and metabolism (pitta). When vata is out of balance, the metabolism will be disturbed, resulting‘in excess catabolism, which is the breakdown or deterioration process in the body. When anabolism is greater than catabolism. there is an in- creased rate of growth and repair of the organs and tissues. Excess pitta disturbs metabolism, excess kapha increases the rate of anabolism: and excess vata creates emaciation (catabolism). In childhood, anabolism and the kapha elementsare predomi- nant, since this is the time of greatest physical growth. In adulthood, metabolism and the element of pitta are most apparent. because at this stage the body is matured and stable. In old age. catabolism and vata are most in evidence, as the body begins to deteriorate.

    "text": "MENTAL CONSTITUTIONS On the mental and astral planes, three attributes, or gunas, cor- respond to the three humors that make up the physical constitu- tion. In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, these three attributes provide the basis for distinctions in human temperament and in- dividual differences in psychological and moral dispositions. The three basic attributes are satva, rajas and tamas. Satva expresses essence, understanding, purity, clarity, com- passion and love. Rajas implies movement, aggressiveness and ex- troversion. The rajas mind operates on a sensual level. Tamas manifests in ignorance, inertia, heaviness and dullness. People of satvic temperament have healthy bodies and their behavior and consciousness are very pure. They believe in the ex- istence of God and are religious and often very holy people. Individuals of rajas temperament are interested in business, prosperity, power, prestige and position. They enjoy wealth and are generally extroverted. They may believe in God but they also may have sudden changes of belief. They are very political. Tamasic people are lazy, selfish and capable of destroying others. They generally have little respect for others and are not religious. All their activities are egotistical. The person of satvic temperament attains self-realization without much effort while rajas and tamasic types must make more effort to attain this state. These three subtle mental energies are responsible for behavioral patterns, which may be altered and improved through the practice of spiritual disciplines such as yoga. The Ayurvedic physician (vaidya} can assist in this behavior modification. He is familiar with the functioning of these attributes — satva, rajas and tamas — and he can determine which predominate in the individual by observing behavior and diet.

    "text": "Chapter IV Disease Process ealth is order: disease is disorder. Within the body, there is aconstant interaction between order and disorder. The wise man learns to be fully aware of the presence of disorder in his body and then sets about to reestablish order. He understands that order is inherent in disorder and that a return to health is thus possible. The internal environment of the body is constantly reacting to the external environment. Disorder occurs when these two are out of balance. To change the internal environment in order to bring it into balance with the external environment, one must understand how the disease process occurs within the psychosomatic being. Ayurveda provides explanations of disease that make it possible to restore order and health from disorder and disease. In Ayurveda, the concept of health is fundamental to the understanding of disease. Dis means ‘deprived of,’’ and ease means “comfort.” Therefore, before discussing disease, we must under- stand the meaning of comfort or health. A state of health exists when: the digestive fire (agni) is in a balanced condition: the bodily humors (vata-pitta-Rapha) are in equilibrium; the three waste pro- ducts (urine, feces and sweat) are produced at normal levels and are in balance: the senses are functioning normally; and the body. mind and consciousness are harmoniously working as one. When the balance of any of these systems is disturbed, the disease pro- cess begins. Because a balance of the above-mentioned elements and functions is responsible for natural resistance and immunity. even contagious diseases cannot affect the person who is in good health. Thus, imbalances of the body and mind are responsible for physical and psychological pain and misery. DISEASE CLASSIFICATION According to Ayurveda, disease may be classified according to 37",

The disease process may begin in the stomach or in the intestines, but manifest in the heart or lungs. Thus, disease symptoms may appear in a site other than the locus of origin. Diseases are also classified according to the causative factors and bodily dosha: vata-pitta-kapha. DISEASE PRONENESS The individual constitution determines disease-proneness. For example, people of kapha constitution have a definite tendency toward kapha diseases. They may experience repeated attacks of tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis and congestion in the lungs. Similarly, individuals of pitta constitution are susceptible to gallbladder, bile and liver disorders, hyperacidity. peptic ulcer. gastritis and inflam- matory diseases. Pitta types also suffer from skin disorders such as hives and rash. Vata people are very susceptible to gas, lower back pain, arthritis, sciatica. paralysis and neuralgia. Vata diseases have their origin in the large intestine: pitta diseases in the small in- testine; and kapha disorders in the stomach. Imbalanced humors in these areas will create certain signs and symptoms. The imbalance causing the disease may originate in the con- sciousness in the form of some negative awareness and it may then manifest in the mind, where the seed of the disease may lie in the deeper subconscious in the form of anger, fear or attachment. These emotions will manifest through the mind into the body. Repressed fear will create derangement of vata; anger, excess pitta: and envy, greed and attachment, aggravated kapha. These imbal- ances of the tridosha affect natural body resistance (the immune sys- tem - agni) and thus the body becomes susceptible to disease. Sometimes, the imbalance causing the disease-process may first occur in the body and then manifest in the mind and consciousness.",

Thus, there is a direct connection between diet, habits, environment and emotional disorders. Impairment of the bodily humors, vata-pitta-kapha, creates toxins (ama) that are circulated throughout the body. During this circula- tion, toxins accumulate in the weak areas of the body. If the joint is a weak area, for example. disease will manifest there. What creates these toxins and bodily weaknesses? KEY TO HEALTH OR DISEASE - ‘AGNI’ Agni is the biological fire that governs metabolism. It is similar in its function to pitta and can be considered an integral part of the pitta system in the body, functioning as a catalytic agent in digestion and metabolism. Pitta contains heat-energy which helps digestion. This heat-energy is agni. Pitta and agni are essentially the same with this subtle difference: pitta is the container and agni is the content. Pitta manifests in the stomach as the gastric fire, agni. Agni is acidic in nature and its action breaks down food and stimulates digestion. Agni is also subtly related to the movement of vata because bodily air enkindles bodily fire. In every tissue and cell, agni is present and necessary for maintaining the nutrition of the tissues and the maintenance of the auto-immune mechanism. Agni destroys micro-organisms, foreign bacteria and toxins in the stomach and small and large intestines. In this way, it protects the flora in these organs. Longevity depends upon agni. Intelligence, understanding, perception and comprehension are also the functions of agni. The color of the skin is maintained by agni. and the enzyme system and metabolism totally depend upon agni.",

This material, which is called ama, clogs the intestines and other channels, such as capillaries and blood vessels. It even- tually undergoes many chemical changes which create toxins. These toxins are absorbed into the blood and enter the general cir- culation. They eventually accumulate in the weaker parts of the body, where they create contraction, clogging, stagnation and weakness of the organs and reduce the immune mechanism of the respective tissues. Finally, a disease condition manifests in the affected organs and is identified as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and so on. The root of all disease is ama. There are many causes for the development of ama. For example, whenever incompatible foods are ingested, agni will be directly affected as a result of the toxins, or ama, created from these poorly digested foods. If the tongue is coated with a white film, this symptom indicates that ama exists in the large intestine, small intestine or stomach, depending upon which part of the tongue is coated. (See section and diagram on tongue diagnosis in Chapter VI.) Ama develops when agni's function is retarded: however, over- active agni is also detrimental. When agni becomes hyperactive, the digestive process burns away, through overcombustion, the nor- mal biological nutrients in the food and emaciation results. This condition also lowers the body's immunity. REPRESSED EMOTIONS Toxins are also created by emotional factors. Repressed anger, for example, completely changes the flora of the gallbladder, bile duct and small intestine and aggravates pitta, causing inflamed pat- ches on the mucous membranes of the stomach and small intes- tine.

Feces are carried to the rectum for evacuation: urine is car- ried to the kidneys for filtration and then stored in the bladder for elimination; and sweat is eliminated through the pores of the skin. Though they are considered bodily waste products, the urine and feces are not strictly waste. They are, in fact, to some extent essential to the physiological functioning of their respective organs. For example, feces supply nutrition through intestinal tissues: many nutrients remain in the feces after digestion. Later, after these are absorbed, the feces are eliminated. Feces also give strength to the large intestine and maintain its tone. If a person has no feces, the intestine will collapse. A person who suffers from constipation lives longer than one who suffers from diarrhea. If diarrhea continues for fifteen days, death will follow.

The urinary system removes water (kleda), salt and nitrogenous wastes (dhatu malas). The urinary system also helps to maintain the normal concentration of water elec- trolytes within the body fluids. It helps to regulate the volume of body fluid and aids in the control of red blood cell production and blood pressure. Thus. the urine helps to maintain the balance of the three humours — vata-pitta-kapha — and water. Clinical Examination of Urine: In a clean vessel, collect the early morning urine in mid-stream. Observe the color. If the color is blackish- brown, this indicates a Vata disorder. if the color is dark-yellow, a Pitta disorder. Also, when there is constipation or the body has less intake of water, urine will be dark yellow. If the urine is cloudy, there is a Kapha disorder. A red color in the urine indicates a blood disorder. Vata Oil Drop Test With a dropper, place one drop of sesame oil in a sample of urine.

The following are the seven most important dhatus in serial order: 1) Rasa (plasma) contains nutrients from digested food and nourishes all the tissues. organs and systems. 2) Rakta (blood) governs oxygenation in all tissues and vital organs and maintains life. 3) Mamsa (muscle) covers the delicate vital organs, performs the movements of the joints and maintains the physical strength of the body. 4) Meda (fat) maintains the lubrication and oiliness of all the tissues. 5) Asthi (bone) gives support to the body structure. 6) Majja (marrow and nerves) fills up the bony spaces and carries motor and sensory impulses. 7) Shukra and Artav (reproductive tissues) contain the ingre- dients of all tissues and are responsible for reproduction. The seven dhatus are understood in a natural, biological, serial order of manifestation. The post-digestion of food, called ‘nutrient plasma.’ ahara rasa, contains the nutrition for all the dhatus. This ‘nutrient plasma’ is transformed and nourished with the help of heat, called dhatu agni, of each respective dhatu. Rasa is transformed into rakta, which is further manifested into mamsa, meda, etc. This transformation results from three basic ac- tions: irrigation (nutrients are carried to the seven dhatus through the blood vessels): selectivity (each dhatu extracts the nutrients it requires in order to perform its physiological functions}: and direct transformation (as the nutritional substances pass through each dhatu, the food for the formation of each subsequent dhatu is pro- duced). These three processes — irrigation, selectivity and transfor- mation — operate simultaneously in the formation of the seven dhatus.",

    "text": "CHAPTER V Attributes yurveda encompasses a subtle medical science of attri- butes or qualities. These attributes are also called gunas. Charak, the great Ayurvedic physician, found that all organic and inorganic substances, as well as all thoughts and ac- tions have definite attributes. These attributes contain potential energy while the actions express kinetic energy. Attributes and ac- tions are closely related since the potential energy of the attributes eventually becomes action or kinetic energy. According to Ayurveda, there are twenty basic attributes. The accompanying table shows these twenty attributes and their actions. After close observation of the universe and man, Charak cate- gorized the twenty basic attributes into ten antagonistic pairs (e.g., hot and cold: slow and fast; dull and sharp; wet and dry). These op- posite forces function together. The universe as a whole is the manifestation of the two most basic opposites, male and female energy. Thus it is possible to understand the universe in terms of the interactions of opposing forces that manifest as the basic attributes. Vata, pitta and kapha each have their own attributes, and substances having similar attributes will tend to aggravate the related bodily humor by the law of like-increases-like. For instance. the summer season has attributes similar to those of pitta — hot. dry, light, motile and penetrating. Naturally, in the summer, pitta in the body will be aggravated. Vata is light. subtle. dry, mobile, rough and cold. So, in the fall season, which also exhibits these at- tributes, vata will tend to be aggravated in the human constitution. Lastly, Rapha is liquid, heavy, cold, sticky and cloudy: so in winter when these characteristics predominate in the external environ- ment, internal kapha tends to be aggravated.",

However, if the individual continually ingests heavy kapha-causing foods, which inhibit the light attributes of the body, over a period of time that individual's bodily attributes will be altered from vata (light) to kapha (heavy). In this way, the attributes of the body may be changed, in spite of the inherent natural tendencies of the constitution. To understand and appreciate the Ayurvedic concept of at- tributes, one should meditate deeply upon them. The examination of attributes is a very subtle experience and it demands constant awareness. If one eats hot, spicy chilis, for instance, what do the senses reflect? Because of the sharp and penetrating action of this food, one immediately experiences such bodily sensations as heat, sweating and a burning sensation in-the mouth: Also on the follow- ing day, the urine and feces might create a burning sensation. The concepts governing the pharmacology, therapeutics and ‘ food preparation in Ayurveda are based on the action and reaction of the twenty attributes to and upon one another. Through understanding of these attributes, balance of the tridosha may be maintained. mN 49",

    "text": "CHAPTER VI Diagnosis n the West, the term diagnosis generally refers to identification of the disease after it has manifested. However, in Ayurveda, the concept of diagnosis implies a moment-to-moment monitoring of the interactions between order (health) and disorder (disease) in the body. The disease process is a reaction between the bodily humors and the tissues. The symptoms of disease are always related to derangement of the balance of the tridosha. Once we understand the nature of the imbalance; balance may be reestablished through treatment. Ayurveda teaches very precise methods for understanding the disease process before any overt signs of the disease have mani- fested. By detecting early symptoms of imbalance and disease reaction in the body, one can determine the nature of future bodily reactions. Day-to-day observation of the pulse, tongue, face, eyes, nails and lips provide subtle indicators. Through these, the student of Ayurveda can learn what pathological processes are occurring in - the body, which organs are impaired and where dosha and toxins- have accumulated. Thus, by checking the body's indicators regular- ly, pathological symptoms can be detected early and preventative measures taken. Ayurveda teaches that the patient is a living book and, for understanding and physical well-being, he or she must be read daily. EXAMINATION OF THE RADIAL PULSE As the diagram shows, the radial pulse is felt with the first three fingers: the index. middle and ring fingers. To make a complete ex- amination of the pulse, the doctor faces the patient and takes the pulse of each of his patient's wrists. The indicators of the pulse vary from the left to right side, so it is best to check the pulse on both sides of the body. The pulse should not be taken after exertion, massage, eating, bathing or sex.",

Big, beautiful and attractive eyes indicate a kapha constitution. Pitta eyes are lustrous and sensitive to light, with reddened whites and have a tendency to be nearsighted. According to Ayurveda, the eyes derive their energy from the basic fire element. The fiery energy in the retina results in sensitivity to light. Thus, people of pitta constitution, having an abundance of fire in the body, often have eyes that are hypersensitive to light. If the eyes are prominent, there is a dysfunction of the thyroid gland. If the conjunctiva is pale. anemia is present; if it is yellow. the liver is weak. One should also examine the color, size and shape of the iris. A small iris indicates weak joints. If there is a white ring around the iris, there is excessive intake of salt or sugar. In the middle-aged, this also may be a sign of bodily stress. If the white ring is very pro- minent and very white (especially in the middle-aged), this in- dicates degeneration in the joints. The joints will pop and crack and arthritis and joint pain are likely. Brownish-black spots in the iris indicate unabsorbed iron in the intestine. In addition to the diagnostic techniques mentioned in the previous pages, Ayurveda also employs other means of clinical examination, namely, palpation, percussion, auscultation and inquiry. Additionally, there are examinations of the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, urine, stool, sputum, sweat, speech and physiognomy. DW 68",

    "text": "CHAPTER VII Treatment ll Ayurvedic treatment attempts to establish a balance between the bodily humors, vata-pitta-kapha. As discussed in the fourth chapter, disease results when these three are out of balance. According to Ayurvedic teaching, the initiation of any form of treatment (whether it be medication, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, allopathy or any other) without first eliminating the toxins in the system that are responsible for the disease, will only push these poisons deeper into the tissues. Symptomatic relief of the dis- ease process may result from superficial treatment. However, the fundamental cause of the illness will not be affected and the pro- blem will therefore manifest again in the same or another form. There are two types of Ayurvedic treatment: elimination of tox- ins and neutralization of toxins. These treatments may be applied on both the physical and emotional levels. EMOTIONAL RELEASE Let us first deal with the emotional or psychological factors. Anger, fear, anxiety, nervousness, jealousy, possessiveness and greed are common human emotions. Yet most people learn in childhood not to express these negative emotions. As a result, one begins at an early age to repress the natural expressions of these feelings. The science of Ayurveda teaches that the individual must release these emotions which, if they remain repressed, will cause imbalances resulting in disease-causing toxins. The Ayurvedic technique for dealing with negativity is: obser- vation and release. For example, when anger appears, one should be completely aware of it: watch this feeling as it unfolds from beginning to end. From this observation, one can learn about the nature of the anger and then let the anger go, release it. All nega- tive emotions may be dealt with in this way. Ayurveda teaches that 69",

If one represses fear, the kidneys will be disturbed; anger, the liver; greed and possessiveness, the heart and spleen. THE PANCHA KARMA For numerous ailments such as excess mucus in the chest, bile in the intestines, kapha in the stomach or gas accumulation in the large intestine, physical elimination may be used. For such treat- ment, Ayurveda suggests pancha karma. These processes are cleans- ing to the body, mind and emotions. Pancha means “‘five’’ and kar- ma means “‘actions’’ or “‘process’’. The five basic processes are: vomiting; purgatives or laxatives; medicated enemas; nasal ad- ministration of medication and purification of the blood. THERAPEUTIC VOMITING (Vaman) When there is congestion in the lungs causing repeated attacks of bronchitis, cough, cold or asthma, the Ayurvedic treatment is therapeutic vomiting (vamana), to eliminate the mucus-causing ex- cess kapha. First, three or four glasses of licorice or calamus root tea are administered: then vomiting is stimulated by rubbing the tongue, which releases emotions. Or, in the morning before brushing the teeth, one may take two glasses of salt water, which will aggravate kapha. Then rub the tongue to induce vomiting. Once the mucus is released, the patient will feel instantly relieved. Con- gestion, wheezing and breathlessness will disappear and the sinuses will become clear. Therapeutic vomiting is also indicated for skin diseases, chronic asthma, diabetes, chronic cold, lymphatic obstruction, chronic indigestion, edema (swelling), epilepsy (between attacks), chronic sinus problems and repeated attacks of tonsillitis.

For example, senna leaf tea is a mild laxative. However, in people of vata constitution, this tea might create griping pain, since its action aggravates peristaltic movement in the large intestine.

Vata is mainly located in the colon. Bones are also the site of Vata. Hence, the medication administered rectally works up to the Asthi Dhatu. The mucus membrane of the colon is related to the outer covering of the bones (periosteum), which nourishes the bones. Therefore, any medication given rectally goes into the deeper tissues, like bones, and corrects Vata disorders.

BLOOD-LETTING (Rakta Moksha) Toxins that are absorbed into the bloodstream through the gastrointestinal tract circulate throughout the body. They may manifest under the skin or in the joint-spaces, creating disease. In such cases, elimination of toxins and purification of the blood is necessary. For repeated attacks of skin disorders such as urticaria, rash. eczema, acne, scabies, leucoderma, chronic itching and hives, blood-letting (rakta moksha) is indicated. It also is effective in cases of enlarged liver and spleen, and for gout. Pitta is manifested in the waste products of the blood, so in many pitta disorders, such as rash and acne, the toxins are circu- lated in the blood system. Thus, for many pitta ailments, extracting a small amount of blood from the vein relieves the tension created by the toxins in the blood. * Blood-letting also stimulates antitoxic substances in the blood stream which helps develop the immune mechanism in the blood system. Thus, the toxins are neutralized enabling radical cures of many blood and bone disorders. Blood-letting also is contra-indicated in cases of anemia. edema and weakness.

Other blood-purifying herbs are saffron, sandalwood powder, turmeric and calamus root powder. Pomegranate juice, orange juice and asparagus root are also beneficial for blood ail- ments.

Palliation involves neutralizing the toxins by enkindling agni and stimulating the diges- tion through fasting.

Sustained hunger and thirst, exercise, sunbathing and sitting in the fresh air are other means of neutralizing toxins. DV 79",

Thus, this science of life offers everyone the freedom to recover health by understanding the body and its needs. Fundamental to the individual's ability to remain healthy, accor- ding to Ayurveda, are the maintenance of a sound diet and a stable, healthy routine. Also important are the pursuit of traditional prac- tices such as yoga and breathing exercises; and an understanding of the spiritual practices that can create harmony and happiness. Diet should be chosen to suit the individual constitution. If one understands the constitution and its relationship to the qualities of various foods, then it is possible to select a proper diet. One needs to take into account the taste of the food (sweet. sour, salty, pungent, bitter or astringent) and also whether it is heavy or light. hot- or cold-producing, oily or dry. liquid or solid. The seasons of the year must also be considered in choosing diet. The accompanying table provides a list of the foods that are helpful or harmful for each constitution. The up-pointing arrows | next to each food category on the chart indicate that these substances aggravate the corresponding factor. The down-pointing arrows indicate foods that decrease the humor such foods being good for the individual of that particular constitution. For instance, dry fruits, apples, melons, potatoes, tomatoes, eggplant. ice cream, beef, peas and green salad aggravate vata.

Each mouthful should be chewed at least thirty-two times before it is swallowed. This practice allows the digestive en- zymes in the mouth to do their work properly and. in addition, it gives the stomach time to prepare for the arrival of the masticated food. It is important that one eats at a moderate speed. How much food you take at one time also is important. One- third of the stomach should be filled with food, one-third with water and one-third with air. The amount of food eaten at a meal should be the equivalent of two handsful of food. If one eats in ex- cess, the stomach will expand and demand additional food. An overeater’s stomach expands like a balloon. Overeating also results in the creation of additional toxins in the digestive tract. The food becomes a poison that the body must eliminate through effort. One should eat and drink with discipline and regularity for eating is a meditation. Eating in this way will nourish your body mind and consciousness and will also enhance longevity. Water plays a vital role in maintaining balance in the body. Water may be taken in the form of fruit juices. Although fruit juice should not be taken during meals, water is necessary at meals. One should sip water while eating. Water taken with meals becomes a nectar that aids digestion. If a quantity of water-is drunk after the completion of a meal, the digestive juices will be diluted and diges- tion hampered. Climate will affect the amount of water the body requires. If there is indigestion, one should observe a warm-water fast.",

The food becomes a poison that the body must eliminate through effort. One should eat and drink with discipline and regularity for eating is a meditation. Eating in this way will nourish your body mind and consciousness and will also enhance longevity. Water plays a vital role in maintaining balance in the body. Water may be taken in the form of fruit juices. Although fruit juice should not be taken during meals, water is necessary at meals. One should sip water while eating. Water taken with meals becomes a nectar that aids digestion. If a quantity of water-is drunk after the completion of a meal, the digestive juices will be diluted and diges- tion hampered. Climate will affect the amount of water the body requires. If there is indigestion, one should observe a warm-water fast. This practice will aid cleansing and increase agni. Cold water will cool down agni; therefore, ice cold water is poison to the system and hot water is nectar. The digestion is affected when one drinks a lot of water. Too much water can result in retention and additional body weight. FASTING Before a fast is undertaken, consideration must be given to the individual constitution. In the West, people sometimes observe 85",

    "text": "fasts for ten, fifteen, twenty or more days without considering their constitutions. This lack of understanding of constitutional require- ments may have detrimental effects. A person of vata constitution should not observe a fast for more than three days. Not eating increases lightness in the body and vata (bodily air) is also light. So, the vata element becomes impaired if a fast is continued too long and this impaired element will create fear, anxiety, nervousness, and weakness. The same restriction on length of fasting holds for individuals of pitta constitution. A fast of more than four days will aggravate pitta, increasing the fire element in the body. This increased pitta will cause psycho/physical reactions of anger, hate and dizziness. People with kapha constitutions, however, may observe pro- longed fasts. They will feel a pleasant sensation of increased light- ness, greater awareness and an opening of consciousness. Clarity and understanding will improve. lf a juice fast is undertaken, it is important to remember that grape juice is good for the vata constitution; pomegranate juice for. the pitta constitution; and apple juice for the kapha constitution. Each day of the fast, drink about one and one-half quarts of the juice diluted with water. The digestive system is resting during a fast. It is important not to place strain on the agni, the digestive fire, during this time. During fasting, the digestive fire becomes enkindled and, since there is no food to digest. agni slowly burns away the long-existing toxins in the intestines. Ayurveda teaches that during a fast certain herbs such as ginger, black pepper. cayenne pepper and curry, which have medicinal value because of their hot. spicy attributes, may be used to help neutralize toxins in the system.",

This prac- tice allows the digestive system to rest. VITAMINS In the West. taking vitamins is regarded as a means to create or maintain good health. Physicians and_health-professionals prescribe vitamins routinely to their patients and such practices as taking massive doses of vitamin C to prevent colds are common. However, if the individual constitution is not considered, such doses of vitamins may create imbalances in the dosha. The human body has a capacity to generate the vitamins it needs and dependence upon external vitamins, without consideration of the individual constitution and condition of agni, may create an excess of vitamins in the body (hypervitaminosis). Many people who regularly take vitamins and minerals to sup- plement their diets continue to suffer from the same deficiencies for which they are taking supplements because they are unable to properly digest, assimilate and absorb these natural] and synthetic vitamins.

    "text": "CHAPTER IX Taste he element of water is the basis for the sensory experience of taste. The tongue must be wet in order to taste a sub- stance. Try drying your tongue and then putting a small amount of sugar or pepper on it. You will not be able to taste it. A wet tongue is necessary for the perception of taste. There are six tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent. bitter and astringent. These six basic tastes are derived from the five elements. The sweet taste contains Earth and Water elements; sour, Earth and Fire; and salty, Water and Fire. The pungent taste contains Fire and Air: bitter, Air and Ether; and astringent, Air and Earth. People of vata constitution should avoid-bitter, pungent and as- tringent substances in excess which increase air and have a tenden- cy to cause gas. Substances containing sweet. sour and salty tastes are good for individuals of vata constitutions. People of pitta constitution should avoid sour, salty and pungent substances which aggravate bodily fire. However, sweet , bitter and astringent tastes are beneficial for individuals of pitta constitution. Kapha individuals should avoid foods containing sweet, sour and salty tastes for they increase bodily water. They should choose food of pungent. bitter and astringent tastes. RASA, VIRYA AND VIPAK Ayurvedic pharmacology is based upon the concepts of rasa, virya and vipak. These concepts have to do with the subtle phenomena relating to taste and to hot and cold effects of foods. Organic and inorganic substances create different tastes and temperature sensations when they pass through the mouth, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. When a substance is placed on the tongue, the first experience of that taste is called rasa.",

Food also has a postdigestive effect which is called vipak. For instance, most starchy foods become sweet after chewing and digestion, so their postdigestive taste, or vipak, is sweet. The Ayurvedic pharmacology is based upon rasya, virya and vipak of substances. in daily observation it is found that there are numerous other substances which have a specific unexplained ac- tion in the body. To acknowledge this action, Charak has used the term prabhav which literally means specific action without regard to rasa, virya and vipak or, the exception to the rule. The concept of rasa, virya and vipak is not only applicable to foods and herbs but also to everything including gems, stones, minerals, metals, color and even the mind and emotions. Below is a table which gives the general rules for determining rasa. virya and vipak. Also, an example of prabhav, or an exception, is listed for each taste. Rasa Virya Vipak Prabhav Sweet Cold Sweet Honey Hot (virya) Sour Hot Sour Lemon Cold {virya} Salty Hot Sweet Tamari Cold (virya) Pungent Hot Pungent Onion Cold (virya) Bitter Cold Pungent Turmeric Hot (virya} Astringent Cold Pungent Pomegranate Sweet (vipak) Thus, in general, sweet and salty tastes have sweet vipak: the sour taste has sour vipak, and the pungent, bitter and astringent tastes have pungent vipak. Thus, rasa and vipak are directly related to the tastes of substances, while virya is related to their hot and cold effects. These three directly influence the tridosha and also influence nutrition and transformation of the bodily tissues or dhatus. These qualities can only be understood through individual experience.",

    "text": "CHAPTER X Lifestyle and Routine ccording to Ayurveda, routine plays a very important role in health. A natural life is a life regulated according to the individual constitution. It is best to have a daily regimen governing all daily actions such as the time one wakes up in the morning and the time one begins body purifications and meditation. Early in the morning, preferably before sunrise, one should wake up, excrete waste products and clean the teeth and mouth. Next, one should look at the tongue, eyes, nose and throat and clean them. By examining the tongue, it is possible to detect pathological changes that may be occurring in the respective organs. After this examination, drinking a glass of warm water will help to clean the kidneys and large intestine. To clean the tongue. use a silver scraper. This process will serve to massage the tongue as well as the internal organs that correlate with the different areas of the tongue. One should then massage the body with oil and take a bath. This will produce a sense of freshness and alertness. After the bath, put on comfortable clothes for exercise and, meditation. Breathing exercises also are important in the daily regimen. After exercises, rest comfortably on the back with arms and legs outstretched and breathe from the lower abdomen. Breakfast may follow exercise and meditation. Lunch should be eaten before noon, if possible, and dinner before sunset. It is best to go to bed before ten o'clock. This regimen follows the flow of energy within the body and in the external environment. It is necessary at all times to remain aware of that flow in order to get the maximum benefit from your daily routine. Other practices may be added to the routine depending on the individual constitution.",

    "text": "Certain sleeping habits are advisable. Since the left side of a person contains female, or lunar, energy and the right side con- tains male, or solar, energy, the position in which one sleeps and breathes has a significant effect on the constitution and the balance of energies in the body. If one always sleeps on the left side, it will suppress the lunar energy and aggravate the solar energy. The aggravation of solar energy may create pitta in the body. So, a person of pitta constitu- tion should sleep on the right side. When one sleeps on the left side, lunar energy is suppressed and solar energy is opened. Sleeping in this position is recommended for vata and kapha types. SUGGESTIONS FOR A CREATIVE, HEALTHY LIFE Routine © Awaken before sunrise. © Evacuate bowels and bladder after awakening. ¢ Bathe every day to create a sense of bodily freshness. © Twelve pranayamas in the morning or evening create freshness of mind and body. ® Do not take breakfast after 8:00 a.m. ® Wash hands before and after eating. ® Brush teeth after meals. ¢ Fifteen minutes after meals take a short walk. ® Eat in silence with awareness of food. ® Eat slowly. e Each day massage the gums with the finger and sesame oil. ® Fast one day a week to help reduce toxins in the body. ® Sleep before 10:00 p.m. Diet and Digestion ¢ One teaspoon of grated fresh ginger with a pinch of salt is a good appetizer. ® Drinking lassi (buttermilk) with a pinch of ginger or cumin powder helps digestion. © A teaspoon of ghee with rice helps digestion. 101",

There are also divisions of time within the day: morning, midday, afternoon, evening, midnight and dawn: and of the year into seasons. Like time, the bodily humors are constantly in motion. There is a definite relationship between the movement of the tridosha and the movement or passage of time. The increase or decrease of these three humors in the body is related to the cycles of time. Morning, from sunrise till ten o'clock, is a time of kapha. Because of the predominance of kapha humor at this time, one feels energetic and fresh and also a little heavy. At mid-morning. kapha slowly merges into pitta. From ten in the morning till two in the afternoon is the time when pitta is secreted and hunger increases. One feels hungry, light and hot. The afternoon from two o'clock until the sun sets is the time of vata when one feels active, light and supple. Early in the evening from about six o'clock until ten is again Rapha time, a period of cool air, inertia and little energy. Then from ten at night till two in the morning are the peak hours of pitta when food is digested. Early in the morning before sunrise is again vata time. Because vata creates movement, people awaken and excrete wastes. Breakfast should be eaten early in the morning between about seven and eight o'clock. Pitta and vata people should eat breakfast: however, since eating at Rapha time will increase kapha in the body, people of kapha constitution should not eat breakfast.",

If the time of eating is changed so that meals are taken in keeping with the rhythm of the tridosha, a drastic change in one’s living habits will occur. Not only the time of day but also the seasons of the year are related to the movements of the tridosha. In the fall, September, Oc- tober and November, the leaves fall, there is wind and the tem- perature begins to drop. At this time of year. vata predominates. Winter lasts from December to February. It is a time of clouds. snow and cold temperatures. This weather increases kapha and dur- ing this time colds, congestion, cough, bronchitis and pharyngitis are prevalent. Spring, March through May, is the junction between winter and summer. Kapha is aggravated in early spring and pitta in the later part of spring. In early spring, the accumulated kapha of winter is li- quified and slowly dries. The heat of the later spring increases the heat of pitta in the body, encouraging pitta disorders such as sum- mer diarrhea, burning eyes, sunburn, hives, rash, dermatitis and burning feet. It can be demonstrated, therefore, that changes in the time of day and season produce changes in the bodily humors, vata, pitta and kapha.

    "text": "CHAPTER XII Longevity rom the time of physical birth unti! physical death, the body is engaged in a continuous struggle against the aging pro- cess. Because continuous breakdown of the bodily tissues and organs at the cellular level causes deterioration and degenera- tion, it is at the cellular level that rejuvenation must take place. The tridosha play a very important role in the maintenance of cellular health and longevity. Each dosha plays a vital part in up- holding the functioning of each of the billions of cells that constitute the human body. Kapha maintains longevity on the cellular level. Pitta governs digestion and nutrition. Vata, which is closely related to pranic life energy, governs all life functions. On a deeper level, to combat aging it is necessary to balance the three subtle essences within the body: prana, ojas and tejas. The functioning of prana. ojas and tejas corresponds, at a subtler level of creation, to the functioning of vata, kapha and pitta, respectively. Proper diet, exercise and lifestyle can create a balance among these three subtle essences, ensuring long life. Prana is the life energy that performs respiration, oxygenation and circulation. It also governs all the motor and sensory functions. The vital pranic force enkindles the central bodily fire (agni). Natural intelligence of the body is expressed spontaneously through prana. For example, if a child has a deficiency of iron or calcium, the body's natural intelligence, governed by prana., will lead the child to eat mud which is a source of these minerals. The seat of prana is in the head and prana governs all higher cerebral activities. The functions of mind, memory, thought and emotions are all under the control of prana.",

This prana also regulates the circulation of ojas in the fetus. Thus, in all humans. even in the unborn, a disorder of prana may create an imbalance of ojas and tejas and vice-versa. Ojas is the essence of the seven dhatus or bodily tissues. It is the vital energy that governs the hormonal balance. The super-fine ele- ment of shukralartav which is the essence of all dhatus, is located in the heart. Ojas is the vital energy that controls the life-functions with the help of prana. Ojas contains all of the five basic elements and all the vital substances of the bodily tissues. It is responsible for the auto-immune system and for mental intelligence. Because ojas is related to kapha, aggravation of kapha displaces ojas and vice-versa. Displaced ojas creates the kapha-related disorders of diabetes, looseness of the bones and joints and numbness of the limbs. Decreased ojas will create vata-related reac- tions such as fear. general weakness, inability of the senses to perceive, loss of consciousness and death. Balanced ojas is necessary for biological strength and immunity. Ghee helps to enhance ojas. Mother's milk promotes ojas in the body of the child so it is important that the child receive mother's milk in order to develop biological strength. During the eighth month of pregnancy, ojas travels into the fetus from the body of the mother. Thus, if birth takes place prematurely before this transference of ojas, the baby will have difficulty sur- viving. This phenomenon demonstrates the importance of ojas in the maintenance of life functions.",

Tejas is the essence of a very subtle fire that governs metabolism through the enzyme system. Agni, the central fire in the body, promotes digestion. absorption and assimilation of food. The further transformation of the ingredients of nutrition into the subtle tissues is governed by a subtle level of energy of agni — this is tejas. Tejas is necessary for the nourishing and transformation of each dhatu. Every dhatu has its own tejas, or dhatu-agni. This essence is responsible for the physiological functioning of the subtle tissues. When tejas is aggravated, it burns away ojas reducing immunity and overstimulating pranic activity. Aggravated prana produces degenerative disorders in the dhatus. Lack of tejas results in over- _ production of unhealthy tissue which creates growth of tumors and obstructs the flow of pranic energy. Improper diet, bad living habits and overuse of drugs will cause an imbalance in tejas. Substances that are hot, sharp and penetrating directly enhance tejas. Just as it is essential for health to ensure balance among the tridosha, the dhatus and the three malas or bodily wastes. it is also im- portant for longevity that prana, ojas and tejas remain in balance. To create such balance. the rejuvenation process taught by Ayurveda is most effective. Rejuvenation must take place on the physical. mental and spiritual levels. Before starting the physical rejuvenation program, the body must be cleansed.

    "text": "administration of herbs and purification of the blood. (For a detail- ed description of these treatments, see Chapter VII.) Vomiting cleanses the stomach which is the seat of kapha; purgation purifies the small intestine, the seat of pitta; medicated enemas cleanse the large intestine, the seat of vata; and nasal administration of herbs clarifies the mind and consciousness. To purify the blood, blood- letting is necessary; this treatment cleanses the blood so that the blood plasma may carry the rejuvenating nutrients of the herbs to the deep tissues. Mental rejuvenation involves calming the mind. A quiet, meditative mind also helps to maintain longevity. Therefore, one must learn to “‘witness”’ all mental activities, thoughts and emotions, remaining detached from the experience. To promote mental peace, one Ayurvedic recommendation is isolation and avoidance of worldly affairs and society. However, this approach is not prac- tical for most people. Hence, Ayurveda recommends a second method of mental rejuvenation, one in which the individual learns to be in the world but not of the world. With this approach, he observes his attachments to determine which of them creates stress. A life without attachment and stress is the happiest, healthiest and most peaceful one. Such a life creates natural longevity. Celibacy and spiritual discipline also are useful for rejuvena- tion as are yogic practices. These disciplines lead to spiritual understanding and a healthfully altered way of living that pro- motes rejuvenation. Modern medicine has developed the technology to sustain the life of the bodily functions, even after the communication of the body with the emotions and the spirit of the individual has ceased.

Discipline of the body, mind and spirit is gained through pursuit of such traditional practices as yoga, pranayama and tantra. Such practices will bring man spiritual and physical freedom. YOGA According to Ayurveda, the practice of yoga, which is a spiri- tual science of life, is a very important, natural, preventive measure to ensure good health. Ayurveda and yoga are sister sciences. In India, it is traditional to study Ayurveda before taking up the prac- tice of yoga, because Ayurveda is the science of the body and only when the body has become fit is the individual considered ready to study the spiritual science of yoga. The yogic practices described by the father of yoga, Patanjali, are very useful in maintaining good health, happiness and longev- ity. Patanjali described the eight limbs of yoga and yogic practices. These are: the natural regulation of the nervous system; discipline: cleansing; postures; concentration; contemplation; the awakening of awareness; and the state of perfect equilibrium. Yoga brings man to the natural state of tranquility which is equilibrium. Thus, yogic exercises have both preventive and curative value. Yogic practices help to bring natural order and balance to the neurohormones and the metabolism and improve the endocrine metabolism and thus provide fortification against stress. Yogic practices for the treatment of stress and stress-related disorders (such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and obesity) are remarkably effective. Yoga is the science of union with the Ultimate Being. Ayurveda is the science of living. of daily life. When yogis perform certain postures and follow certain disciplines. they open up and move energies that have accumulated and stagnated in the energy centers. When stagnant, these energies create various ailments.",

(The accompany- ing diagrams indicate which postures are good for each constitu- tional type as well as for specific disorders.) For example, a person of pitta constitution should not perform the headstand posture for more than one minute. If he does, the result will be mental dis- orientation. Similarly, a person of vata constitution should not per- form the shoulder stand for a long time, because the shoulder stand exerts too much weight on the seventh cervical vertebra. This vertebra is sensitive and the delicate bone structure of vata may cause a shift in the spinal column. Repressed anger will shift the cervical vertebra to the right side and repressed fear will shift it to the left. The person of kapha constitution should not perform the hidden lotus posture for an extended time because this pose causes direct pressure on the adrenal glands.

Through this internal observation, you are being cleansed of distractions: you are arriving at the beginning of a radical transformation. As unobstructed awareness increases, you will begin to enjoy increased relaxation and store- houses of energy will unlock within you: these are the benedictions of meditative practice.

Stroking against the grain of body hairs facilitates penetration of the oil into the hair follicles. This technique is indicated because vata people have dry skin and closed follicles. Massage for a person of pitta constitution should be done with sunflower or sandalwood oil because these have cooling properties. For kapha constitution, one can use corn or calamus root oil or the massage can be given without oil. Certain techniques apply to specific disorders. For example, for stagnation of blood and poor circulation, massage toward the heart. For. muscle spasms, tightness and soreness, massage in the direction of muscle fibers. Massage should be done in the morning during kapha time for kapha disorders, in the evening for vata disorders and in the afternoon for pitta disorders. For kapha people, deep massage is beneficial. A gentle massage is good for vata and pitta individuals. ANS 128",

In addition to these herbal cures, remedies less famil- iar in the West such as the use of the healing properties of gems, metals and colors are recommended. The classic Ayurvedic texts - state that all substances found in nature have medicinal value when used in the proper manner. The purpose of these remedies is not to suppress the effects of illness as is often the case in Western medicine, but rather to bring the out-of-balance factors in the body into harmony once more, thereby eliminating the cause of disease. The purpose and action of Ayurvedic remedies are to eradicate the disease itself, not just the symptoms of illness. Ayurveda is a very practical science and the advice that follows, suggesting simple treatments for minor ailments and util- izing herbs commonly found in the kitchen, is straightforward and effective. At least eighty percent of all diseases are self-limiting: that is, if nothing is done to alter the disease process, the body's own mechanisms will eventually restore the nervous system to a state of health. The information in this chapter specifically indicates methods to support the body in its natural process of balancing the internal and external environments, thus promoting healing. Of course, if the ailment or disease does not subside, after appli- cation of these methods, a physician should be consulted. At times symptoms that appear minor may have serious repercussions.

    "text": "the healing properties of metals, gems and stones. Ayurvedic teachings hold that everything in existence is endowed with the energy of Universal Consciousness. All forms of matter are simply the outer manifestations of this energy. Prana, the vital force of life. flows from this universal energy which is the essence of all matter. Thus, metals, stones and gems are the outer manifestations of cer- tain forms of energy and these materials contain pranic energy reservoirs that may be drawn upon for healing purposes. The an- cient rishis of India discovered these healing energy-effects through meditation. Adverse influences upon the normal functions of the body, mind and consciousness may be counteracted through the use of gems and metals. When they are applied to the skin, they induce an electromagnetic influence that acts upon the physical cells and deeper tissues. For example. by wearing an armlet of silver and lead, one may avoid impending liver trouble. Physical health depends on cosmic influences as well as the spiritual and mental state of the individual. As a house is protected from lightning by a copper rod, so the body may be protected from electrical and magnetic radiation in the atmosphere through the use of gems and metals. Pure metals emit an astral light that provides a powerful counteraction to the negative pull of the planets. All metals contain tremendous healing energy. The heavy metals, such as mercury, gold, silver, copper.iron, lead and tin are used in healing. However, even pure metals may contain certain impurities that are toxic to the vital organs, such.as the kidney. liver, spleen and heart. Therefore, the Ayurvedic teachings prescribe specific methods for their purification. The metal is heated and treated with oil, cow's urine, milk, ghee, buttermilk or the sour gruel of grains.",

Two teaspoonsful of this copper-water should be taken three times a day for one month. It is also helpful to wear a copper bracelet on the wrist. Gold: is an effective nervine tonic. It improves memory and in- telligence, strengthens the heart muscle and increases stamina. Gold is good for hysteria, epilepsy, heart attacks, weak lungs and spleen. Purified gold is turned into ash by burning it in a fire. The energy of gold also may be harnessed through the use of gold- medicated water. To prepare such water, place a golden ornament (without any stone) into two glasses of water and boil until half the water evaporates. The electronic energy of the gold will enter the water during this process. One teaspoonful of this water may be taken two or three times a day. Gold water will energize the heart causing a feeble pulse to become strong. It also will improve memory, intelligence and comprehension and stimulate awakening awareness. Gold has hot properties and therefore should be used cautiously if one has a pitta constitution. Some people will not tolerate gold and may break out in a rash if gold is applied.

    "text": "Conclusion yurveda comprehensively illuminates the basic laws and principles governing life on earth. To understand Ayurveda is to understand the forces that engender our well-being as well as those that lie at the root of disease. This brief introduction has been an attempt to introduce the reader to this life-science in a concise and informative way. It represents only a fraction of the total wealth of Ayurvedic wisdom. However, the intention, in which the author hopes he has succeeded. has been to offer a basic appreciation of the vast potential and profound healing power of Ayurveda; and to supply practical knowledge applicable to the reader's daily life. All the basic concepts of Ayurveda have been introduced here. yet the reader may still have unanswefed questions about this science of life. In fact. this book may have raised more questions than it has answered. This may be unavoidable when one treats, in an introductory manner, an ancient system of wisdom that encom- passes that vast horizon where human consciousness merges into Cosmic Consciousness. ; The author hopes that he has communicated some of the basic truths of this profound science in a readily understandable manner. Only you, the reader, can judge if his effort has succeeded in its in- tention. Your comments regarding this book will be most welcome. for they will help considerably in producing the next projected text which is to be a more detailed treatment of this ancient life-science.",

Peristalsis slows, the bowels no longer move without aid. The organs begin to shut.down. As the Earth element continues to dissolve into the Water element, there is a feeling of flowingness, a liquidity as the solidity that has always intensified identification with the body begins to melt, a feeling of fluidity. As the Water element begins to dissolve into the Fire element, the feeling of fluidity becomes miore like a warm mist. The bodily fluids begin to slow, the mouth and eyes become dry. circulation slows, blood pres- sure drops. As the circulation begins to thicken and stop, blood settles in the lowest extremities. A feeling of lightness ensues. As the Fire element dissolves into the Air element, feel- ings of warmth and cold dissipate, physical comfort and discomfort no longer have meaning. The body temperature drops until it reaches a stage where the body begins to cool and becomes pale. Digestion stops. A feeling of lightness, as of heat rising. becomes predominant. A feeling of dissolving into yet subtler and subtler boundarylessness. As the Air element dissolves into Consciousness itself there is a feeling of edgelessness. The out breath having become longer than the in breath has dissolved into Space and there is no longer the experience of bodily form or function but just a sense of vast expanding airiness, a dissolving into pure being.* *From Who Diesby Stephen Levine.
