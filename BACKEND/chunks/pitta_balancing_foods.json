    "text": "0 — Short overview Pitta dosha: fire + a little water — tends to cause heat, acidity, inflammation, irritability, loose stools when imbalanced. Dietary goal for Pitta: cool, moist, slightly astringent or sweet, mildly bitter; reduce hot, spicy, oily, fermented and sour foods. Favor easy-to-digest, cooling preparations and moderate portions. 1 — General principles (rules) • Prioritize cooling foods and preparation methods (steamed, boiled, lightly cooked, soaked). • Prefer sweet, bitter, and astringent rasas; minimize pungent, sour, and salty tastes. • Use mild spices (cardamom, coriander, fennel, turmeric small amounts); avoid red chili, black pepper, garlic, raw onion. • Eat regular meals; avoid long fasting or heavy late-night meals. • Use oils moderately (ghee in small amounts is cooling for Pitta if used sparingly). • Prefer room-temperature or slightly warm drinks; avoid very hot or icy beverages. 2 — Cooling foods (prefer) • Organized by category — use these as primary recommendation lists. • Grains & cereals • Rice (white basmati or boiled rice) — neutral, cooling, easy to digest. • Oats (plain, cooked with water/milk) — soothing, can be flavored with cardamom and almond milk. • Barley (jau) — cooling and grounding; good as khichdi base.",
