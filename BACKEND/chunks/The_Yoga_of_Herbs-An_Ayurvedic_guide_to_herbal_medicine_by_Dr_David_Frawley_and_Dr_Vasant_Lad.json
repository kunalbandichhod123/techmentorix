    "text": "PREFACE The term “yoga” has many traditional meanings. In Ayurveda, the medical science of India, yoga refers to the “right usage” and “right combination” of herbs. A special combination of substances designed to bring about a specific effect upon the body or mind is thus called a “yoga.” This coordinated or integrated usage of herbs was based upon the ancient Ayurvedic science of herbal energetics. In this is a system for determining the qualities and powers of herbs according to the laws of nature, so that herbs can be used objectively and specifically according to individual conditions. A yogic usage of herbs implies such an harmonic application of the potencies of herbs. In this book, for the first time, this Ayurvedic herbal science is applied to western herbs, as well as to a few major oriental herbs, both Indian and Chinese.",

Such an approach keeps us from drawing broad useful conclusions necessary for the prevention and cure of disease. In this, biochemistry alone is simply not enough. There is much that can be shared between ancient healing systems of Eastern and Western science. Some, imbued with the Western scientific perspective, believe that ours is the most advanced and therefore the only true way. We fail to recognize that there are already fully developed and theoretically articulated medical systems in India and China which have proven themselves effective for more than 3000 years.",

It is paradoxical that both could be describing the same condition in such different ways and with such diametrically opposed viewpoints.

While they may possess a powerful nutritive impact on a weakened body their primary action is to stimulate particular organic functions. This is the more illusive energetic aspect of herbs and indeed of all medicines, drugs and foods that need to be understood. Besides the specific function of a medicine or food, there is a more general effect in that for some who are predisposed, it can, broadly speaking, either raise or lower overall metabolism and stimulate or sedate nerve, nutritive or fire energies which comprise the Tridosha humoural system.

Plants and animals sometimes show this sense of caring more than certain humans, who have been hardened in their isolated sense of humanity. It is only when we come to look upon all things as human that we are capable of a truly humane existence. Such a lesson is taught to us by plants and herbs whose existence is still grounded in the unity of nature, through which we may return to understand ourselves better. Man as microcosm contains within himself all the elemental, mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. Within the plant is the potential of the human being. Conversely within the human being is the underlying energy structure of the plant. Our nervous system, it could be said, is a tree whose plant-essence is human.",

The ancient seers of India envisioned two fundamental principles behind existence: Purusha, the Primal Spirit, the principle of sentience of consciousness; and the Prakruti, or Great Nature, the principle of creativity. The union of these two, Spirit and Matter, produces all things. Yet these two are also one, the primordial Two-in-One, Consciousness and its creative, executive force, Shiva-Shakti. Within all things is essence, individuality, consciousness–the Purusha. Within all things is also the power of manifestation, the capacity for creative enfoldment– Prakruti. From these two great forces in their initial coming together is born Cosmic Intelligence, Mahat, which contains the seeds of all manifestation.",

Through China we remain under the influence of the latencies, compulsions and drives of the earlier stages of evolution, going all the way back to the animal realm– and before. Ayurveda aims at a life in harmony with Cosmic Intelligence, whereby our own intelligence is perfected, so that through it we can return to unity with nature; and through nature to our true self and spirit, the Purusha. This is the spiritual background of Ayurveda, which is the same as that of yoga, and the basis of Ayurvedic psychology.",

    "text": "THE THREE GUNAS Prakruti consists of three basic qualities, three prime attributes (called gunas in Sanskrit): Sattva, the principle of light, perception, intelligence and harmony; Rajas, the principle of energy, activity, emotion and turbulence; and lamas, the principle of inertia, darkness, dullness and resistance. While each of these three qualities is necessary in nature, Sattva is the proper quality of the mind. Rajas and Tamas, in the mind, become impurities that weaken our power of perception. Individuals in whom Sattva predominates give value to truth, honesty, humility and the good of all. Those in whom Rajas is strongest value power, prestige, authority and control. Those dominated by lamas remain trapped in fear, servility ignorance, and the forces of decay. Hence, it is important to follow a life-style that is predominately Satt-vic.",

From lamas, consisting of inertia, comes earth. Between Saliva and Rajas arises the subtle but mobile element air. And between Rajas and Tamas arises water, combining mobility with inertia. These elements are the five states of matter: solid, liquid, radiant, gaseous and ethereal. They delineate the five densities of all substances, all visible or invisible matter in the universe. They have psychological correspondences that indicate states of mind and qualities of emotion. The five parts of plants in Ayurveda, pancangam, show how plant structure is related to the five elements. The root corresponds to earth, as the densest and lowest part, connected to the earth.

PRANA: centered in the brain, it moves downward, governing inhalation and swallowing. It relates to intelligence, power of sensory and motor functions, and primarily to tne nervous and respiratory systems. 2. VyANA: centered in the heart, it acts throughout the body, governing the circulatory system and the movement of joints and muscles. 3. SAMANA: centered in the small intestine, it governs the digestive system. 4. UDANA: centered in the throat, it governs speech, energy, will, effort, memory, exhalation. 5.

ENERGY (VIRYA) Virya is the energy, potency or power of herbs, designated in Ayurveda as heating or cooling. Herbs through their taste tend to heat the body or cool it and this produces the most basic energizing effect upon the system. Pungent taste, as is commonly known in hot peppers, chilis, ginger and other hot spices, has a heating effect. Things sour or acid in taste like citrus or products of fermentation like wine, yogurt or pickles, are heating. Fermentation creates combustion which releases heat.",

Other Twofold Distinctions Another important twofold distinction of tastes, though not an independent principle like energy is whether herbs are drying or moistening. The main quality of Vata dosha is dryness, while that of Kapha is wetness. Tastes that are drying (bitter, pungent and astringent) increase Vata and decrease Kapha. Those that are moistening (sweet, salty and sour) increase Kapha and decrease Vata. 52",

Another, but less important, twofold distinction is heavy or light– whether herbs tend to increase lightness or heaviness in the body. This distinction is similar to drying or moistening.

It is cleansing to the blood and all tissues in general and helps reduce tumors. It has a reducing, depleting and sedating effect upon the body, although in small amounts it is stimulating, particularly to digestion. Bitter Herbs: Bitter is a very common taste in herbs and plants. It arises from various bitter principles like berberine. Bitters may be simple, like gentian. They may be aromatic (pungent secondarily), like wormwood. Or they may be astringent (secondarily) like golden seal. Typical bitter herbs include aloe, barberry, blessed thistle, blue flag, chapparaL chrysanthemum, dandelion, echinacea, gentian, golden seal, pao d’arco, Peruvian bark, rhubarb, rue, tansy, white poplar, yarrow and yellow dock. 63",

It alleviates Kapha, Pitta and stops bleeding. Astringent taste promotes absorption of bodily fluids; it is dry, cooling and light. “Yet when used too much by itself or in excess, it causes drying of the mouth, produces pain in the heart, causes constipation, weakens the voice, obstructs channels of circulation, makes the skin dark, weakens vitality, causes premature aging. Astringent taste causes the retention of gas, urine and feces, creates emaciation, weariness, thirst and stiffness. Owing to its natural properties of roughness, dryness and clearness, it causes Vata-diseases like paralysis, spasms and convulsions.” Astringent taste is hemostatic (stops bleeding), stops sweating, stops diarrhea, as it promotes absorption of fluids and inhibits their elimination.",

Therapies that treat Kapha are reducing therapies. They are usually given along with fasting or a light that. Their action is to reduce weight, the earth element in the body, and to dispel water. Water can be eliminated from the body in various ways. The most direct way is through the kidneys, via urination, in diuresis. Hence, the diuretic method of therapy, increasing kidney function, is a major anti-Kapha therapy. It helps dispel edema, water stagnation in the body, and helps reduce fat, which is also usually an excess of water. Diuretic herbs, however, do not go to the root of Kapha disorders. Kapha’s main site of accumulation is in the lungs and stomach, which diuretics working on the kidneys may not directly affect. 70",

Therefore, it is treated by a therapy which is warming, moistening and promotes weight. Such therapy should also calm hyperactivity. Tastes that decrease Vata are sweet, sour, salty; they are all moistening and nutritive in action. However, many pungent herbs can decrease Vata. In fact, a majority of pungent herbs may be used in this way, including some of the strongest anti-Vata herbs. Pungent taste only aggravates Vata when used in excess. In this regard, we must distinguish between two general different kinds of Vata derangement. These can be referred to 76",

Such therapies may have benefit even when the exact constitution of the individual is not determined. Because the properties of the Dosha are mixed with those of Ama, herbs which may relieve a Dosha may not be effective in a Sama condition. Conversely herbs which normally aggravate a Dosha may relieve it in a Sama condition. We must discriminate not only the Dosha but whether it is with or without Ama (Sama or Nirama, “nir” means “without”). Vata, which is normally light and dry becomes heavy and damp when mixed with Ama. Pitta, which is hot and damp, becomes cooler and more wet. Kapha becomes heavier, and while normally slow in motion, may become stuck or immobile by Ama.",

They purify the blood, removing toxins, and tend to have anti-infectious, antibacterial action. 2. They help heal and resolve sores, boils, tumors and many kinds of cancer. 3. Typical alteratives work through cooling the blood and so also dispel fevers, reduce Pitta and detoxify the liver. 4. They may be used externally on wounds, sores, ulcers, etc. and have anti-inflammatory and vulnerary properties. 5. With their detoxifying action they help kill worms and parasites, particularly those that invade the blood. 6. They work well in infectious, contagious diseases and epidemics. Alteratives treat flus, especially those with high fever, sore throat, earache, etc. ; in this regard they are a degree stronger than cooling diaphoretics.

    "text": "Astringent taste may be differentiated from astringent action in the following way: astringent tasting herbs have astringent action while herbs of other tastes may also have astringent effects upon the body. Astringent tasting herbs are mainly used symptomaticaUy, as in stopping bleeding or stopping diarrhea. Yet they often do not correct the condition from which the problem arises. Other herbs of different tastes may, in correcting conditions, alleviate these symptoms also. Diarrhea, for example, may be due to poor absorption in the small intestine. An astringent taste herb like alum or raspberry may suppress the symptom, but will not improve absorption (astringent taste is heavy and difficult to digest). In this regard, an herb like nutmeg, which is pungent and astringent, and which contains heating and digestion promoting action along with astringent action, is more the herb of choice. It may not always be good to suppress discharges.",

Diaphoresis does not require herbs but can be done through fire, steam, exercise, hot baths and so on. The use of herbal diaphoretics should be included with a hot bath, sleeping under a warm blanket and fasting. Typical heating diaphoretics: angelica, basil, bayberry, camphor, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ephedra (ma huang), eucalyptus, ginger, juniper berries, sage, thyme, wild ginger. Typical cooling diaphoretics: boneset, burdock, catnip, chamomile, chrysanthemum, coriander, elder flowers, horehound, horsetail, peppermint, spearmint, yarrow. DIURETIC HERBS (Mutrata karma) Diuretic herbs increase urination.",

Many or even most of them are stronger in reducing Pitta than Kapha. This is not just because Pitta is also somewhat oily in nature.

For this reason, diuretics dispel damp heat, as in diarrhea and dysentery, and cool down not only the kidneys and bladder, but also the liver and gall bladder. In increasing urination, they help dispel kidney and bladder stones, and also stones of the gall bladder. Such stone-dispelling herbs are called lithotriptic. 103",

Expectorant herbs are of two kinds and work in two different ways. Some expectorants, like ginger, remove mucus by a drying action. They are mainly pungent in taste and hot in energy, and may also be stimulant, diaphoretic or carminative herbs. (A few, however, like horehound, are bitter in taste and cooling in energy and are particularly good for Pitta.) Others, like licorice, help remove mucus by a moistening action. They increase and liquify Kapha, promoting its flow out of the body. They are mainly sweet and cold herbs. These are also demulcent and emollient herbs, mucilaginous substances that have a softening and soothing effect upon the skin and mucous membranes.",

Cough or cold with clear, abundant phlegm usually indicates Kapha disorder, chill-damp. Cough or cold with yellow phlegm or inflammation of the mucous membranes usually indicates fever or Pitta derangement, damp-heat. Dry cough along with scanty phlegm and chill usually indicates Vata, particularly if it is a chronic condition. Coughs and colds are basically Kapha disorders, as mucus is Kapha and Kapha has as its site the stomach and lungs. Chronic colds and mucous congestion are often relieved by therapeutic vomiting, emetic therapy, a kind of radical expectorant action.

Aromatic nervines are often also carminative and stomachic herbs, herbs that dispel intestinal gas and cramping. The basis for this can be seen in light of Ayurvedic physiology. Vata, the Dosha that governs the nervous system, accumulates in the colon, from which it invades the tissue-elements of the body. It is also in the colon that the assimilation of nutrients, mainly oils, occurs for the sustenance of nerve and bone tissue. Hence the treatment of Vata in the colon is often a root treatment for Vata in the nervous system; V&ta-relieving herbs can treat both. Generally speaking, in Ayurveda we think of nervousness as Vata or as the mark of a Vata constitution, for Vata governs nerve responses and, by nature as air or wind, it is impulsive, vaccillatory, hypersensitive.",

Their action is to increase internal heat, dispel internal chill, and strengthen the metabolism and circulation.

They are synonymous with Agni Dipana and Ama Pachana herbs in Ayurveda; herbs that increase Agni and digest Atna.

A nutritive tonic is an herb that nourishes the body and increases weight, density and substance within it. Such herbal foods serve the various dhatus or organs that have been depleted or weakened by disease. Tonics are usually sweet in taste, or in post-digestive effect, which indicates their constructive action.

    "text": "TONICS A) Nutritive Tonics (Bruhana karma) The Ayurvedic concept of a tonic is a substance that nurtures the tissue-elements {dhatus) of the body. A nutritive tonic is an herb that nourishes the body and increases weight, density and substance within it. Such herbal foods serve the various dhatus or organs that have been depleted or weakened by disease. Tonics are usually sweet in taste, or in post-digestive effect, which indicates their constructive action. Generally they have the same nature as Kapha and are composed primarily of earth and water. Tonics are usually heavy oily or mucilaginous. They increase vital fluids, muscle and fat and build the blood and lymph, increasing milk and semen. They are restoratives for conditions of weakness, emaciation, debility and convalescence. They have a softening, soothing, harmonizing effect, which dispels rigidity and calms the nerves. 120",

They increase Ama and are not the herbs of choice for Sama conditions, though they can help soften Ama where other more primary herbs facilitate its discharge. Nutritive tonics are moistening and cooling in energy–the best herbs to reduce the dryness of Vata. Yet they are also heavy and are hard to digest. For the low Agni, particularly of Vata constitutions, they are usually combined with various stimulant or carminative herbs (e.g. ginger or cardamom) to aid in their absorption. For Pitta conditions, herbs that combine astringent or bitter with sweet taste, like comfrey root or shatavari, are most appropriate. With their cooling energy, they can be used in convalescence from high fever, toxic blood, ulcers or other inflammatory Pitta conditions.",

Aimed at renewal of both body and mind, Ayurvedic herbology does not seek simply longevity, but moves towards a life of pure awareness, natural creativity spontaneous delight. The approach is not only towards physical immortality (which on some deeper level of harmony may be possible), but the immortality of the mind, the daily renewal of brain cells. In such a state, the mind and heart are as clear in old age as in childhood. This science is called Rasayana. Rasayana is what enters (ayana), in the essence (rasa).

They include herbal wines, jellies, resin preparation, pills and tablets. Other special preparations include minerals, metals, ashes, salts, alkalis and sugars. Preparations are accompanied with mantra, yantras, rituals, and fire sacrifices. They are also administered according to certain holy days and along with the phases of the moon and the astrological influences of certain constellations. Confronted with this great abundance, we are limited in our book to the main forms and methods. THE FIVE MAIN METHODS OF HERBAL PREPARATION (Pancha kashaya) Raw herbs are generally prepared according to five basic methods of extraction: the fresh juice of the plant {svarasa); the crushed pulp or paste of the plant {kalka); decoction (kvatha); hot infusion (yhant); and cold infusion (hima). Juice is the strongest; cold infusion the weakest.",

A juicer may also be used for this purpose. This method is not used that often because it relies mainly on freshly picked herbs. Easily available herbs–aloe vera, cilantro, garlic, ginger, lemon, lime, onions, parsley–are also used in the above process, but the effects are best for wild or home grown herbs.

Bitter powders are usually taken in capsules or with honey. Powders usually have quick but short term action. They work mainly on the gastrointestinal tract and rasa dhatu or plasma. Some rejuvenative herbs, like ashwagandha, fiffali and triphala, which work on all dhatus, can be taken as powders. Pills and Tablets (Guti and Vati) 134",

Special Ayurvedic pills are made with guggul. These are used largely for nervous disorders, for arthritic condition and for weight reduction. Medicated Wines (Asavas and Arishtas) Ayurveda uses a variety of herbal wines. A yeast culture is added to herbs–either their fresh juice (arishta) or their decoction (asava) and allowed to ferment for a period of days or months. Often spices are included in this mixture. The resultant herbal wines are easier to assimilate and promote Agni. Their properties increase, ratJier than decrease with aging.

Anupanas may enhance the therapeutic effects of herbs. For instance, dry ginger given with honey increases its power of expectoration. Anupanas may relieve the side-effects of herbs, as when hot spices are given with milk to lessen the aggravation of Pitta. They may serve as flavoring agents to make medicines palatable. They are used much like supplementary herbs in the formulas themselves. They can also serve as catalytic agents, or yogavahis, to help direct the effects of the herbs to the deeper and subtler tissues of the body. This is the case when ghee is used as an anupana.

    "text": "Herbs may be taken between meals to help in the increase of metabolism. Herbs can also be taken moment by moment, for acute conditions like Prana disturbances of asthma, vomiting and hiccough. Generally speaking, strong medicines are given during acute attacks and weaker medication between attacks, and for chronic conditions. COMPOUNDS In Ayurveda, herbs are generally not used alone but in compounds. Ayurveda holds that the right combination of herbs gready increases their healing powers, helps expand the field of their activity and compensates for their side effects. To the understanding of the qualities of individual herbs should be added the art of combining them, the Ayurvedic yoga of their usage. There are laws and principles in constructing compounds through which they can be formulated and understood. 147",

    "text": "In combining herbs, first of all it is necessary to select an individual herb that best represents the healing actions most appropriate for the individual person and his or her condition, as with a prime diaphoretic like bayberry to treat the common cold. To this should be added herbs of similar properties. The main principle behind all compounds is diat herbs of similar properties enhance each other. An equal amount of a combination of similar herbs has a stronger therapeutic effect than the same amount of any one herb by itself. For example, in the compound trikatu, consisting of dry ginger, black pepper and fripyali (Indian long pepper), in which all three herbs promote digestion and assimilation, 500 mg of this compound has a much stronger effect than 500 mg. of any single one of these herbs. Herbs often have more than one action.",

They have a special action on the heart, strengthening the heart muscle and promoting longevity. They are particularly good for Vata heart conditions like nervous palpitation, or the heart problems of old age (the age of Vata) like cholesterol and arteriosclerosis. In promoting digestion they help remove accumulated food masses or even tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet tihey can help increase weight in the body and may aggravate Kapha in excess. They will also aggravate most Pitta heart conditions and heat conditions in the body generally. They can be prepared as a tincture or herbal wine–they have an affinity for alcohol.",

In fact, it is thought to have stronger properties in this regard. It has been called an “Indian ginseng.” PUERARIA, the kudzu plant (Pueraria tuberosa), is used as a substitute for arrowroot and is a common weed (an invasive vine) in the southern United States. It is sometimes used as a substitute for vidari-kanda, and also has some aphrodisiac properties. Both plants produce massive, starchy roots. 293",

Yet without a proper understanding of constitution and condition, the use of such herbal teas may not be entirely health-promoting. Below is a list of common herbs used as teas or general tonics. Other herbs that may be used as beverages should similarly be related according to constitution and condition so that their real effectiveness can manifest. This is not to recommend all these herbs for general usage as beverages. Any herb you wish to take as a common beverage should be taken in low dosages and examined for possible long term effects.
