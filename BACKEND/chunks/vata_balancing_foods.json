Core Principles • Prefer warm > cold, cooked > raw, moist > dry, oily > fat-free. • Choose sweet, sour, salty tastes; minimize bitter, pungent, astringent. • Eat at regular times; avoid skipping meals. Best Foods for Vata Grains (soft, warm, easy to digest) • Rice (white or red) • Wheat (chapati, paratha with ghee) • Oats (porridge) • Quinoa (well-cooked) • Semolina (upma) • Why: Provides grounding and steady energy.
