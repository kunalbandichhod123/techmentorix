Procedure of Pranayama: It is, in fact , a practice for complete respiration. Sit in Padmasana or Sukhasana(lotus pose). Keep your spinal cord erect. Inhale fresh air though the nose, filling your abdomen with the air. When the abdomen is full(by inhalation of air) and bloats, retain the breath as long as you can, without suffocating choking, tiring or straining yourself. Now slowly exhale the air. While inhaling the lungs would contract and the abdomen bloat but when air is exhaled, the abdomen will squeeze and lungs expand.", "word_count": 197, "hash": "986de98be8891da6253312a11e9745aca08ccbfb165e4022771dff90206f57e8"}

Heretofore, Ayurveda has been viewed in the West as an esoteric science. Yet it is a simple, prac- tical science of life whose principles are universally applicable to each individual's daily existence. Ayurveda speaks to every ele- ment and facet of human life, offering guidance that has been tested and refined over many centuries to all those who seek greater harmony and peace and longevity. The knowledge supplied in this book will be of lasting value to the reader. The science of Ayurveda is based not on constantly changing research data, but on the eternal wisdom of the rishis who received this science, expressive of the perfect wholeness of Cosmic Con- sciousness, through religious introspection and meditation. Ayur- veda is a timeless science and the reflection and elucidation here. it is hoped, will serve the reader throughout his or her life. Ayurveda is concerned with eight principle branches of medi- cine: pediatrics, gynecology, obstetrics, opthalmology, geriatrics, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), general medicine and surgery. Each of these medical specialties is addressed according to theories of the five elements (Ether, Air, Fire, Water, Earth); the tridosha, or three bodily humors; the seven dhatus, or body tissues: three malas (urine, stools, sweat): and the trinity.of tife: body. mind and spiritual awareness. These concepts are fully elucidated in this introductory text.

The writings of Sushruta impressively anticipated much of modern medicine. He treated in detail, among other topics, post- mortem dissection and plastic surgery procedures which. centuries later, were used as the basis for modern plastic surgery. Sushruta perfected techniques for knitting broken bones with nails; he iden- tified vital points on the body, marmas, which are related to the vital organs. External trauma to these points may be extremely serious or fatal. Among his other numerous contributions, Sushruta also devised a special treatment of bloodletting to cure blood-born disorders.

We use the word religion to denote be- liefs and disciplines conducive toward states of being in which the doors of perception open to all aspects of life. In Ayurveda, the whole of life's journey is considered to be sacred. The word philosophy refers to love of truth and in Ayurveda, truth is Being, Pure Existence, The Source of all life. Ayurveda is a science of truth as it is expressed in life. All Ayurvedic literature is based on the Samkhya philosophy of creation. (The roots of the term Samkhya are two Sanskrit words: sat, meaning ‘truth,’ and khya, meaning to:know.’’) The reader is asked to cultivate an open mind and heart toward the philosophy of Samkhya because of its intimate connection with Ayurveda.

The universe is the child born out of the womb of Prakruti, the Divine Mother. Prakruti creates all forms in the universe, while Purusha is the wit- ness to this creation. It is primordial physical energy containing the three attributes, or gunas, found in all nature, the evolving cosmos. The three gunas are satva (essence), rajas (movement) and tamas (inertia). These three are the foundation for all existence. They are contained in balance in Prakruti. When this balance is disturbed, there is an interaction of the gunas which thus engenders the evo- lution of the universe. The first manifestation from Prakruti is Cosmic Intellect. From Mahad, Ego (Ahamkar) is formed. Ego then manifests into the five senses (tanmatras) and the five motor organs, with the help of satva, thus creating the organic universe. The same Ego further manifests into the five basic elements (bhutas) with the help of tamas, to create the inorganic universe. Rajas is the active vital life force in the body which moves both the organic and inorganic universes to satva and tamas, respectively. So satva and tamas are inactive, potential energies which need the active, kinetic force of rajas.

The word Ayurveda is a Sanskrit term meaning ‘'science of life.” Ayu means “life’’ or “daily living,” and Veda is “knowing.” Ayurveda was first recorded in the Vedas, the world’s oldest extant literature. This healing system has been prac- ticed in daily life in India for more than 5,000 years. AYURVEDA AND HUMAN POTENTIAL Ayurveda teaches that man is a microcosm, a universe within himself. He is a child of the cosmic forces of the external environ- ment, the macrocosm. His individual existenceis indivisible from the total cosmic manifestation. Ayurveda views health and “‘dis- ease” in holistic terms, taking into consideration the inherent rela- tionship between individual and cosmic spirit, individual and cosmic consciousness, energy and matter. According to the teachings of Ayurveda, every human being . has four biological and spiritual instincts: religious, financial, pro- creative and the instinct toward freedom. Balanced good health is the foundation for the fulfillment of these instincts. Ayurveda helps | the healthy person to maintain health, and the diseased person to regain health. It is a medical-metaphysical healing life-science, the mother of all healing arts. The practice of Ayurveda is designed to promote human happiness, health and creative growth. Through studying the teachings of Ayurveda, the practical knowledge of self-healing may be acquired by anyone. By the pro- per balance of all energies in the body, the processes of physical deteriorationand disease can be impressively reduced. This con- cept is basic to Ayurvedic science: the capability of the individual for self-healing.

For thousands of years their teachings were trans- mitted orally from teacher to disciple, and later they were set down in melodious Sanskrit poetry. Though many of these texts have been lost over time, an abundant body off Ayurvedic knowledge survives. Originating in Cosmic Consciousness, this wisdom was in- tuitively received in the hearts of the rishis. They perceived that consciousness was energy manifested into the five basic principles, or elements: Ether (space), Air, Fire. Water and Earth. This concept of the five elements lies at the heart of Ayurvedic science. The rishis perceived that in the beginning the world existed in an unmanifested state of consciousness. From that state of unified consciousness, the subtle vibrations of the cosmic soundless sound aum manifested. From that vibration there first appeared the Ether element. This ethereal element then began to move; its subtle movements created the Air, which is Ether in action. The movement of Ether produced friction, and through that friction heat was generated. Particles of heat-energy combined to form intense light and from this light the Fire element manifested. Thus, Ether manifestedinto Air, and it was the same Ether that further manifested into Fire. Through the heat of the Fire, certain ethereal elements dissolved and liquified, manifesting the Water _element, and then solidified to form the molecules of Earth. In this way, Ether manifested into the four elements of Air, Fire. Water _and Earth.

Among these seven general types, there are in- numerable subtle variations that depend upon the percentage of vata-pitta-kapha elements in the constitution. The constitution is called prakruti in Sanskrit, a term meaning “nature,” “creativity” or “the first creation.” In the body, the first expression of the basic five elements is the constitution. The basic constitution of the individual remains unaltered during the lifetime, as it is gene- tically determined. The combination of elements present at birth remains constant. However, the combination of elements that governs the continuous physiopatho- logical changes in the body alters in response to changes in the environment. Throughout life, there is a ceaseless interaction between the internal and external environment. The external environment compris7s the cosmic forces (macrocosm), while the internal forces (microcosm) are governed by the principles of vata-pitta- kapha. A basic principle of healing in Ayurveda holds that one may create balance in the internal forces working in the individual by altering diet and habits of living to counteract changes in his external environment.

When vata is out of balance, the metabolism will be disturbed, resulting‘in excess catabolism, which is the breakdown or deterioration process in the body. When anabolism is greater than catabolism. there is an in- creased rate of growth and repair of the organs and tissues. Excess pitta disturbs metabolism, excess kapha increases the rate of anabolism: and excess vata creates emaciation (catabolism). In childhood, anabolism and the kapha elementsare predomi- nant, since this is the time of greatest physical growth. In adulthood, metabolism and the element of pitta are most apparent. because at this stage the body is matured and stable.

In the Ayurvedic system of medicine, these three attributes provide the basis for distinctions in human temperament and in- dividual differences in psychological and moral dispositions. The three basic attributes are satva, rajas and tamas. Satva expresses essence, understanding, purity, clarity, com- passion and love. Rajas implies movement, aggressiveness and ex- troversion. The rajas mind operates on a sensual level. Tamas manifests in ignorance, inertia, heaviness and dullness. People of satvic temperament have healthy bodies and their behavior and consciousness are very pure. They believe in the ex- istence of God and are religious and often very holy people. Individuals of rajas temperament are interested in business, prosperity, power, prestige and position. They enjoy wealth and are generally extroverted. They may believe in God but they also may have sudden changes of belief. They are very political. Tamasic people are lazy, selfish and capable of destroying others. They generally have little respect for others and are not religious. All their activities are egotistical. The person of satvic temperament attains self-realization without much effort while rajas and tamasic types must make more effort to attain this state. These three subtle mental energies are responsible for behavioral patterns, which may be altered and improved through the practice of spiritual disciplines such as yoga. The Ayurvedic physician (vaidya} can assist in this behavior modification. He is familiar with the functioning of these attributes — satva, rajas and tamas — and he can determine which predominate in the individual by observing behavior and diet. Using these practical clues, he can assist and guide the patient toward a more balanced mental and physical way of living.

Within the body, there is aconstant interaction between order and disorder. The wise man learns to be fully aware of the presence of disorder in his body and then sets about to reestablish order. He understands that order is inherent in disorder and that a return to health is thus possible. The internal environment of the body is constantly reacting to the external environment. Disorder occurs when these two are out of balance. To change the internal environment in order to bring it into balance with the external environment, one must understand how the disease process occurs within the psychosomatic being. Ayurveda provides explanations of disease that make it possible to restore order and health from disorder and disease. In Ayurveda, the concept of health is fundamental to the understanding of disease. Dis means ‘deprived of,’’ and ease means “comfort.” Therefore, before discussing disease, we must under- stand the meaning of comfort or health. A state of health exists when: the digestive fire (agni) is in a balanced condition: the bodily humors (vata-pitta-Rapha) are in equilibrium; the three waste pro- ducts (urine, feces and sweat) are produced at normal levels and are in balance: the senses are functioning normally; and the body. mind and consciousness are harmoniously working as one. When the balance of any of these systems is disturbed, the disease pro- cess begins. Because a balance of the above-mentioned elements and functions is responsible for natural resistance and immunity. even contagious diseases cannot affect the person who is in good health. Thus, imbalances of the body and mind are responsible for physical and psychological pain and misery.

Disease is also classified according to the site of manifestation: heart, lungs. liver and so forth. The disease process may begin in the stomach or in the intestines, but manifest in the heart or lungs. Thus, disease symptoms may appear in a site other than the locus of origin. Diseases are also classified according to the causative factors and bodily dosha: vata-pitta-kapha. DISEASE PRONENESS The individual constitution determines disease-proneness. For example, people of kapha constitution have a definite tendency toward kapha diseases. They may experience repeated attacks of tonsillitis, sinusitis, bronchitis and congestion in the lungs. Similarly, individuals of pitta constitution are susceptible to gallbladder, bile and liver disorders, hyperacidity. peptic ulcer. gastritis and inflam- matory diseases. Pitta types also suffer from skin disorders such as hives and rash. Vata people are very susceptible to gas, lower back pain, arthritis, sciatica. paralysis and neuralgia. Vata diseases have their origin in the large intestine: pitta diseases in the small in- testine; and kapha disorders in the stomach. Imbalanced humors in these areas will create certain signs and symptoms. The imbalance causing the disease may originate in the con- sciousness in the form of some negative awareness and it may then manifest in the mind, where the seed of the disease may lie in the deeper subconscious in the form of anger, fear or attachment. These emotions will manifest through the mind into the body. Repressed fear will create derangement of vata; anger, excess pitta: and envy, greed and attachment, aggravated kapha. These imbal- ances of the tridosha affect natural body resistance (the immune sys- tem - agni) and thus the body becomes susceptible to disease. Sometimes, the imbalance causing the disease-process may first occur in the body and then manifest in the mind and consciousness.", "word_count": 300, "hash": "b2e66f3982695cdd47f8722857a96c927f1f736becdaa116cfaa633eea066beb"}

These emotions will manifest through the mind into the body. Repressed fear will create derangement of vata; anger, excess pitta: and envy, greed and attachment, aggravated kapha. These imbal- ances of the tridosha affect natural body resistance (the immune sys- tem - agni) and thus the body becomes susceptible to disease. Sometimes, the imbalance causing the disease-process may first occur in the body and then manifest in the mind and consciousness. Foods. living habits and environments with attributes similar to those of the dosha (humor) will be antagonistic to the bodily tissues. They will create an imbalance that is first manifested on the physical level, and later affects the mind through a disturbance in the tridosha. 38", "word_count": 196, "hash": "9b081531b42091f439a4f64e71fd79b89506c5323f94bd9cc44974eeabc629b2"}

KEY TO HEALTH OR DISEASE - ‘AGNI’ Agni is the biological fire that governs metabolism. It is similar in its function to pitta and can be considered an integral part of the pitta system in the body, functioning as a catalytic agent in digestion and metabolism. Pitta contains heat-energy which helps digestion. This heat-energy is agni. Pitta and agni are essentially the same with this subtle difference: pitta is the container and agni is the content. Pitta manifests in the stomach as the gastric fire, agni. Agni is acidic in nature and its action breaks down food and stimulates digestion. Agni is also subtly related to the movement of vata because bodily air enkindles bodily fire. In every tissue and cell, agni is present and necessary for maintaining the nutrition of the tissues and the maintenance of the auto-immune mechanism. Agni destroys micro-organisms, foreign bacteria and toxins in the stomach and small and large intestines. In this way, it protects the flora in these organs. Longevity depends upon agni.

These toxins are absorbed into the blood and enter the general cir- culation.

Finally, a disease condition manifests in the affected organs and is identified as arthritis, diabetes, heart disease and so on. The root of all disease is ama.

These attributes are also called gunas. Charak, the great Ayurvedic physician, found that all organic and inorganic substances, as well as all thoughts and ac- tions have definite attributes. These attributes contain potential energy while the actions express kinetic energy. Attributes and ac- tions are closely related since the potential energy of the attributes eventually becomes action or kinetic energy. According to Ayurveda, there are twenty basic attributes. The accompanying table shows these twenty attributes and their actions. After close observation of the universe and man, Charak cate- gorized the twenty basic attributes into ten antagonistic pairs (e.g., hot and cold: slow and fast; dull and sharp; wet and dry). These op- posite forces function together. The universe as a whole is the manifestation of the two most basic opposites, male and female energy. Thus it is possible to understand the universe in terms of the interactions of opposing forces that manifest as the basic attributes. Vata, pitta and kapha each have their own attributes, and substances having similar attributes will tend to aggravate the related bodily humor by the law of like-increases-like.

However, if the individual continually ingests heavy kapha-causing foods, which inhibit the light attributes of the body, over a period of time that individual's bodily attributes will be altered from vata (light) to kapha (heavy). In this way, the attributes of the body may be changed, in spite of the inherent natural tendencies of the constitution. To understand and appreciate the Ayurvedic concept of at- tributes, one should meditate deeply upon them. The examination of attributes is a very subtle experience and it demands constant awareness. If one eats hot, spicy chilis, for instance, what do the senses reflect? Because of the sharp and penetrating action of this food, one immediately experiences such bodily sensations as heat, sweating and a burning sensation in-the mouth: Also on the follow- ing day, the urine and feces might create a burning sensation. The concepts governing the pharmacology, therapeutics and ‘ food preparation in Ayurveda are based on the action and reaction of the twenty attributes to and upon one another.

However, in Ayurveda, the concept of diagnosis implies a moment-to-moment monitoring of the interactions between order (health) and disorder (disease) in the body. The disease process is a reaction between the bodily humors and the tissues. The symptoms of disease are always related to derangement of the balance of the tridosha. Once we understand the nature of the imbalance; balance may be reestablished through treatment. Ayurveda teaches very precise methods for understanding the disease process before any overt signs of the disease have mani- fested. By detecting early symptoms of imbalance and disease reaction in the body, one can determine the nature of future bodily reactions. Day-to-day observation of the pulse, tongue, face, eyes, nails and lips provide subtle indicators. Through these, the student of Ayurveda can learn what pathological processes are occurring in - the body, which organs are impaired and where dosha and toxins- have accumulated. Thus, by checking the body's indicators regular- ly, pathological symptoms can be detected early and preventative measures taken. Ayurveda teaches that the patient is a living book and, for understanding and physical well-being, he or she must be read daily. EXAMINATION OF THE RADIAL PULSE As the diagram shows, the radial pulse is felt with the first three fingers: the index. middle and ring fingers. To make a complete ex- amination of the pulse, the doctor faces the patient and takes the pulse of each of his patient's wrists. The indicators of the pulse vary from the left to right side, so it is best to check the pulse on both sides of the body. The pulse should not be taken after exertion, massage, eating, bathing or sex.", "word_count": 296, "hash": "14224f2dc04003ef353ff5ad890b8552a7ab52dbf0906a66f1b4ca3e5515edf5"}

If they are dry and rough, this indicates dehydration or a vata derangement. Nervousness and fear also create dryness and tremors of the lips. In anemia, the lips become pale. As a result of chronic smoking, the lips become blackish-brown.

Pitta eyes are lustrous and sensitive to light, with reddened whites and have a tendency to be nearsighted. According to Ayurveda, the eyes derive their energy from the basic fire element. The fiery energy in the retina results in sensitivity to light. Thus, people of pitta constitution, having an abundance of fire in the body, often have eyes that are hypersensitive to light. If the eyes are prominent, there is a dysfunction of the thyroid gland. If the conjunctiva is pale. anemia is present; if it is yellow. the liver is weak. One should also examine the color, size and shape of the iris. A small iris indicates weak joints. If there is a white ring around the iris, there is excessive intake of salt or sugar. In the middle-aged, this also may be a sign of bodily stress. If the white ring is very pro- minent and very white (especially in the middle-aged), this in- dicates degeneration in the joints.

As discussed in the fourth chapter, disease results when these three are out of balance. According to Ayurvedic teaching, the initiation of any form of treatment (whether it be medication, acupuncture, chiropractic, massage, allopathy or any other) without first eliminating the toxins in the system that are responsible for the disease, will only push these poisons deeper into the tissues. Symptomatic relief of the dis- ease process may result from superficial treatment. However, the fundamental cause of the illness will not be affected and the pro- blem will therefore manifest again in the same or another form. There are two types of Ayurvedic treatment: elimination of tox- ins and neutralization of toxins. These treatments may be applied on both the physical and emotional levels. EMOTIONAL RELEASE Let us first deal with the emotional or psychological factors. Anger, fear, anxiety, nervousness, jealousy, possessiveness and greed are common human emotions. Yet most people learn in childhood not to express these negative emotions. As a result, one begins at an early age to repress the natural expressions of these feelings. The science of Ayurveda teaches that the individual must release these emotions which, if they remain repressed, will cause imbalances resulting in disease-causing toxins. The Ayurvedic technique for dealing with negativity is: obser- vation and release. For example, when anger appears, one should be completely aware of it: watch this feeling as it unfolds from beginning to end. From this observation, one can learn about the nature of the anger and then let the anger go, release it. All nega- tive emotions may be dealt with in this way. Ayurveda teaches that 69", "word_count": 286, "hash": "3d897763df2ecf4bbdfde5162a0511b91e76589755144fedb103ffcdcf16e732"}

THE PANCHA KARMA For numerous ailments such as excess mucus in the chest, bile in the intestines, kapha in the stomach or gas accumulation in the large intestine, physical elimination may be used. For such treat- ment, Ayurveda suggests pancha karma. These processes are cleans- ing to the body, mind and emotions. Pancha means “‘five’’ and kar- ma means “‘actions’’ or “‘process’’. The five basic processes are: vomiting; purgatives or laxatives; medicated enemas; nasal ad- ministration of medication and purification of the blood. THERAPEUTIC VOMITING (Vaman) When there is congestion in the lungs causing repeated attacks of bronchitis, cough, cold or asthma, the Ayurvedic treatment is therapeutic vomiting (vamana), to eliminate the mucus-causing ex- cess kapha. First, three or four glasses of licorice or calamus root tea are administered: then vomiting is stimulated by rubbing the tongue, which releases emotions. Or, in the morning before brushing the teeth, one may take two glasses of salt water, which will aggravate kapha. Then rub the tongue to induce vomiting. Once the mucus is released, the patient will feel instantly relieved. Con- gestion, wheezing and breathlessness will disappear and the sinuses will become clear. Therapeutic vomiting is also indicated for skin diseases, chronic asthma, diabetes, chronic cold, lymphatic obstruction, chronic indigestion, edema (swelling), epilepsy (between attacks), chronic sinus problems and repeated attacks of tonsillitis.

Thus, this science of life offers everyone the freedom to recover health by understanding the body and its needs. Fundamental to the individual's ability to remain healthy, accor- ding to Ayurveda, are the maintenance of a sound diet and a stable, healthy routine. Also important are the pursuit of traditional prac- tices such as yoga and breathing exercises; and an understanding of the spiritual practices that can create harmony and happiness. Diet should be chosen to suit the individual constitution. If one understands the constitution and its relationship to the qualities of various foods, then it is possible to select a proper diet. One needs to take into account the taste of the food (sweet. sour, salty, pungent, bitter or astringent) and also whether it is heavy or light. hot- or cold-producing, oily or dry. liquid or solid. The seasons of the year must also be considered in choosing diet. The accompanying table provides a list of the foods that are helpful or harmful for each constitution.

The down-pointing arrows indicate foods that decrease the humor such foods being good for the individual of that particular constitution.

These three directly influence the tridosha and also influence nutrition and transformation of the bodily tissues or dhatus. These qualities can only be understood through individual experience. The following charts serve as a guideline to assist the reader in understanding rasa, virya and vipak and their properties and actions. 89", "word_count": 197, "hash": "313714957783d4071990778eca6bf4827a769263f404c551021c3dcd535ae84b"}

A natural life is a life regulated according to the individual constitution. It is best to have a daily regimen governing all daily actions such as the time one wakes up in the morning and the time one begins body purifications and meditation. Early in the morning, preferably before sunrise, one should wake up, excrete waste products and clean the teeth and mouth. Next, one should look at the tongue, eyes, nose and throat and clean them. By examining the tongue, it is possible to detect pathological changes that may be occurring in the respective organs. After this examination, drinking a glass of warm water will help to clean the kidneys and large intestine. To clean the tongue. use a silver scraper. This process will serve to massage the tongue as well as the internal organs that correlate with the different areas of the tongue. One should then massage the body with oil and take a bath. This will produce a sense of freshness and alertness. After the bath, put on comfortable clothes for exercise and, meditation. Breathing exercises also are important in the daily regimen. After exercises, rest comfortably on the back with arms and legs outstretched and breathe from the lower abdomen. Breakfast may follow exercise and meditation. Lunch should be eaten before noon, if possible, and dinner before sunset. It is best to go to bed before ten o'clock. This regimen follows the flow of energy within the body and in the external environment. It is necessary at all times to remain aware of that flow in order to get the maximum benefit from your daily routine. Other practices may be added to the routine depending on the individual constitution.", "word_count": 299, "hash": "e8aa8555bf134f1b5dccee4f7b123cfb0986562c7c184de8d6d995b83ab07b5c"}

Since the left side of a person contains female, or lunar, energy and the right side con- tains male, or solar, energy, the position in which one sleeps and breathes has a significant effect on the constitution and the balance of energies in the body. If one always sleeps on the left side, it will suppress the lunar energy and aggravate the solar energy. The aggravation of solar energy may create pitta in the body. So, a person of pitta constitu- tion should sleep on the right side. When one sleeps on the left side, lunar energy is suppressed and solar energy is opened. Sleeping in this position is recommended for vata and kapha types.

The substance of time moves and measurements exist to measure these move- ments: seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. There are also divisions of time within the day: morning, midday, afternoon, evening, midnight and dawn: and of the year into seasons. Like time, the bodily humors are constantly in motion. There is a definite relationship between the movement of the tridosha and the movement or passage of time. The increase or decrease of these three humors in the body is related to the cycles of time. Morning, from sunrise till ten o'clock, is a time of kapha. Because of the predominance of kapha humor at this time, one feels energetic and fresh and also a little heavy. At mid-morning. kapha slowly merges into pitta. From ten in the morning till two in the afternoon is the time when pitta is secreted and hunger increases. One feels hungry, light and hot. The afternoon from two o'clock until the sun sets is the time of vata when one feels active, light and supple. Early in the evening from about six o'clock until ten is again Rapha time, a period of cool air, inertia and little energy. Then from ten at night till two in the morning are the peak hours of pitta when food is digested. Early in the morning before sunrise is again vata time. Because vata creates movement, people awaken and excrete wastes. Breakfast should be eaten early in the morning between about seven and eight o'clock.

Discipline of the body, mind and spirit is gained through pursuit of such traditional practices as yoga, pranayama and tantra. Such practices will bring man spiritual and physical freedom. YOGA According to Ayurveda, the practice of yoga, which is a spiri- tual science of life, is a very important, natural, preventive measure to ensure good health. Ayurveda and yoga are sister sciences. In India, it is traditional to study Ayurveda before taking up the prac- tice of yoga, because Ayurveda is the science of the body and only when the body has become fit is the individual considered ready to study the spiritual science of yoga. The yogic practices described by the father of yoga, Patanjali, are very useful in maintaining good health, happiness and longev- ity. Patanjali described the eight limbs of yoga and yogic practices. These are: the natural regulation of the nervous system; discipline: cleansing; postures; concentration; contemplation; the awakening of awareness; and the state of perfect equilibrium. Yoga brings man to the natural state of tranquility which is equilibrium. Thus, yogic exercises have both preventive and curative value. Yogic practices help to bring natural order and balance to the neurohormones and the metabolism and improve the endocrine metabolism and thus provide fortification against stress. Yogic practices for the treatment of stress and stress-related disorders (such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and obesity) are remarkably effective.

Similarly, a person of vata constitution should not per- form the shoulder stand for a long time, because the shoulder stand exerts too much weight on the seventh cervical vertebra. This vertebra is sensitive and the delicate bone structure of vata may cause a shift in the spinal column. Repressed anger will shift the cervical vertebra to the right side and repressed fear will shift it to the left.

Massage for a person of pitta constitution should be done with sunflower or sandalwood oil because these have cooling properties. For kapha constitution, one can use corn or calamus root oil or the massage can be given without oil. Certain techniques apply to specific disorders. For example, for stagnation of blood and poor circulation, massage toward the heart. For. muscle spasms, tightness and soreness, massage in the direction of muscle fibers. Massage should be done in the morning during kapha time for kapha disorders, in the evening for vata disorders and in the afternoon for pitta disorders. For kapha people, deep massage is beneficial.

In addition to these herbal cures, remedies less famil- iar in the West such as the use of the healing properties of gems, metals and colors are recommended. The classic Ayurvedic texts - state that all substances found in nature have medicinal value when used in the proper manner. The purpose of these remedies is not to suppress the effects of illness as is often the case in Western medicine, but rather to bring the out-of-balance factors in the body into harmony once more, thereby eliminating the cause of disease. The purpose and action of Ayurvedic remedies are to eradicate the disease itself, not just the symptoms of illness. Ayurveda is a very practical science and the advice that follows, suggesting simple treatments for minor ailments and util- izing herbs commonly found in the kitchen, is straightforward and effective. At least eighty percent of all diseases are self-limiting: that is, if nothing is done to alter the disease process, the body's own mechanisms will eventually restore the nervous system to a state of health. The information in this chapter specifically indicates methods to support the body in its natural process of balancing the internal and external environments, thus promoting healing. Of course, if the ailment or disease does not subside, after appli- cation of these methods, a physician should be consulted. At times symptoms that appear minor may have serious repercussions.

Ayurvedic teachings hold that everything in existence is endowed with the energy of Universal Consciousness. All forms of matter are simply the outer manifestations of this energy. Prana, the vital force of life. flows from this universal energy which is the essence of all matter. Thus, metals, stones and gems are the outer manifestations of cer- tain forms of energy and these materials contain pranic energy reservoirs that may be drawn upon for healing purposes. The an- cient rishis of India discovered these healing energy-effects through meditation. Adverse influences upon the normal functions of the body, mind and consciousness may be counteracted through the use of gems and metals. When they are applied to the skin, they induce an electromagnetic influence that acts upon the physical cells and deeper tissues. For example. by wearing an armlet of silver and lead, one may avoid impending liver trouble. Physical health depends on cosmic influences as well as the spiritual and mental state of the individual. As a house is protected from lightning by a copper rod, so the body may be protected from electrical and magnetic radiation in the atmosphere through the use of gems and metals. Pure metals emit an astral light that provides a powerful counteraction to the negative pull of the planets. All metals contain tremendous healing energy. The heavy metals, such as mercury, gold, silver, copper.iron, lead and tin are used in healing.

As the Water element begins to dissolve into the Fire element, the feeling of fluidity becomes miore like a warm mist. The bodily fluids begin to slow, the mouth and eyes become dry. circulation slows, blood pres- sure drops. As the circulation begins to thicken and stop, blood settles in the lowest extremities. A feeling of lightness ensues. As the Fire element dissolves into the Air element, feel- ings of warmth and cold dissipate, physical comfort and discomfort no longer have meaning. The body temperature drops until it reaches a stage where the body begins to cool and becomes pale. Digestion stops. A feeling of lightness, as of heat rising. becomes predominant. A feeling of dissolving into yet subtler and subtler boundarylessness. As the Air element dissolves into Consciousness itself there is a feeling of edgelessness.

In Ayurveda, the medical science of India, yoga refers to the “right usage” and “right combination” of herbs.

In this is a system for determining the qualities and powers of herbs according to the laws of nature, so that herbs can be used objectively and specifically according to individual conditions. A yogic usage of herbs implies such an harmonic application of the potencies of herbs.

MEDIA OF INTAKE (Anupana) In Ayurveda, herbal medicines are prescribed to be taken with various mediums of intake, as hot water or milk. Such vehicles for taking herbs are called anupanas. Anupanas may enhance the therapeutic effects of herbs. For instance, dry ginger given with honey increases its power of expectoration. Anupanas may relieve the side-effects of herbs, as when hot spices are given with milk to lessen the aggravation of Pitta. They may serve as flavoring agents to make medicines palatable. They are used much like supplementary herbs in the formulas themselves.
