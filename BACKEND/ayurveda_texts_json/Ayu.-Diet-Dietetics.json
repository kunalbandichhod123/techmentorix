    "text": "Chapter – 1:\nAyurvedic Dietetics - Introduction\n\n Ayurveda throws light on the time tested dietary habits and patterns. Food produced by\nhealthy seeds, in unpolluted soil, water, air, and environment is considered to be the best. This\nis due to positive energy and complete nourishment, which are essential for healthy body-\nmind.\n\n Balanced diet is good for nutrition, energy, maintenance of internal harmony, growth &\ndevelopment and group of other vital functions. The objective of taking balanced diet is not\nonly satiation of body-mind but that also supports other functions with positive energy.\n\n For a health conscious person, it is imperative to know certain details such as:\n\n - Wholesome and unwholesome diet\n - Heavy and light diet\n - Taste factors\n - Constitution of diet in different forms like, i.e. liquid, semi liquid, semi solid, solid\n - Effect on systems organs and metabolism\n - Nutritional values and effects on physical strength and immunity.\n\n Life span, complexion, health, vigor and immunity all depend on good dietary habits.\nFurther, the outcome of the wholesome diet contributes a great deal in establishing a good\npsycho-spiritual framework of an individual.\n\n In Ayurvedic texts specific knowledge of aahar is described. Samhitas and ‘Nighantus’\nare the source of knowledge of food and dietary guidelines. Details about food identification, its\nquality and actions on the body. For example, Bhavprakash Nighantu describes knowledge of\nfood in 24 groups. Few names are like; Haritakyadi, Mamsa, Pushpa, Fal, Dhanya, Shak, Vari,\nDugdha, Dadhi, Takra, Navneet, Ghrut, Tail, Madhu, Ikshu group etc.\n\n* The importance of diet:\n\n In the words of renowned author David Frawley, “As long as we are not living in\nharmony with nature and our constitution, we cannot expect ourselves to be really healed.\nAyurveda gives us the means.”\n\n • According to ayurveda the definition of being healthy is: the balance of all Doshas, all\n seven Dhatus (tissues), Agni (the perfect digestion and assimilation of food) together\n with the regular and efficient evacuation of excretory materials."

Maintaining /\nimproving the health and producing a disease.\n\nGUNA (Physical / Physiological Properties): Depending on the physical form of a food / herb\nlike solid, liquid or gas or its interaction with body tissues, 20 specific characteristics have been\ndescribed. They also have a capacity to increase or decrease the levels of doshas.\n\nVEERYA (Dynamic Property / Potency): The active principle which makes the food/ drug act is\nknown as Veerya. While acting on the body, every food/ drug either proves to be hot (Ushna)\ni.e. Stimulating the overall rate of metabolism, or it is cold (Sheeta), i.e. Lowering down the\nmetabolic activities.\n\nVIPAKA (Dynamic Alteration /Metabolic Property): The interaction of digestive enzymes with\nthe chemical structures providing the taste brings in certain chemical changes because of which\nthe final outcome tends to change. After interacting with digestive juices, chemical structure of\nfood or drugs with sweet, salty and astringent tastes end up in changing to the sweetish\n(Madhur). This is a common law. Final outcome of pungent and bitter substances would be\npungent (Katu) nevertheless. The sour substances remain unchanged even at end. Exception to\nthis rules also exists.\n\nPRABHAVA (Specific Property): The factor which makes a food/ drug specifically effective in\nsome special condition or on some special body system is known as prabhava. This behaves in\nquite a different manner as compared to other drugs having similar pharmacological details,\nviz., Rasa, Guna, Veerya and Vipaka. Typical constituent regarded as unexplainable(Aachintya),\nhence the term Prabhava (specific effect)."

Do not work,\n read or watch television while you eat and sit down and have meals\n\n 2. Try to eat at the same time each day. Do not gulp your food, but chew it thoroughly.\n\n 3. Eat to only 3 quarters of your capacity.\n\n 4. Allow 3-6 hours gap between two meals to give yourself time to digest the previous\n meal properly. If you feel very hungry that is a sure sign that your body needs more\n food. Nevertheless, do not eat if you are not hungry.\n\n 5. Sip water or juice with your meals. Drinks should not be ice-cold as this inhibits\n digestion. Ideally, drink hot water, preferably with a little ginger added into it.\n\n 6. Choose fresh foods, which are produced locally. Three quarter of your menu should be\n consist of warm freshly-prepared food. This is because warm cooked dishes are easier to\n digest than cold and raw. A warm, suitably seasoned meal with spices and a little fat is\n the best choice.\n 7. At the evening meal avoid sour, dairy products, animal protein and raw ingredients. All\n of themare hard to digest. Usually Agni is weak in late evening.\n 8. If possible always eat your main meal at midday since your digestion functions most\n Efficientlyfunctions between 12 and 13 hours.\n 9. Always take time to relax for a few minutes after eating. Vam-kukshi and then walk 100\n steps."

The surest way to eat well is to trust your own body, which will demand what it needs.\n Check your own diet and try to integrate the Ayurvedic guide lines for eating into your\n daily life.\n\n Which diet is best for you\n\n Adjust your diet to suit the time of year.\n\n Adjust the diet according to your constitution.\n\n Ginger and other spices should be used liberally according to your agni and\n constitution.\n\n Need to pay attention to the signals your body gives you, since it will crave a\n particular taste or characteristics to keep its doshas in equilibrium.\n\n Choose foods that balance or pacify your predominant doshas.\n\n Eat food that reduces the energy of your predominant dosha and fortifies your\n secondary or subsidiary doshas.\n\n For example: If you are a kapha type, your menu should include mainly foods which\n pacify your Kapha, your main dosha and strengthen secondary or subsidiary\n doshaVata and Pitta.\n\n According to Ayurveda, the thoughts and emotions becomes part of your food while\n you handle it. If you are angry or tense while preparing food, you may transmit this\n energy. So cook with positive emotions such as love and kindness.\n\n In addition, when possible use simple, non-motorized hand tools to prepare the\n food.\n\n The more your hands come into contact with the food, the more opportunity for the\n food’s energy to mix with yours and the closer you feel to food and the earth from\n which it comes.\n\n Most food should be warm or hot- or at least room temperature and cooked.\n\n Don’t eat reheated or microwaved foods as they have lost their life force or prana.\n\n Never sleep immediate after meals."

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nApart from all the theory of Ayurveda and all its technical aspects, biology and medicinal\ntreatment, knowing your body and trust body intelligence plays paramount role. This aspect is\nknown in common language ‘Taseer’ or ‘Prakriti’ which is nothing but the balance of all doshas\nin the body (Body constitution). To understand and acceptance of self, all other living being as\nthey are and intake of right quantity at right time allows body to remain healthy and sound.\n\nEating right food is important, as well as eating right food, at right time, within right manners\nare also equally important aspects. Many people always think a lot about what we eat and how\nmuch we eat. No doubt they are important factors, but there is something more than it.\nMost important here is to understand how much our body can digest and how much our body\nconverts the diet in to nutrients – or dhatus. Whatever we intake, after digestion it must\nconvert into tissues – like plasma, blood, muscle, bones etc. (we call it dhatu) with the help of\nagni. This shows importance of agni (digestive fire) in the body. Sometimes we see the person\neating highest nutrient food has body issues then the person eating very basic or less food.\nFood conversion in to body tissue is entirely depending on agni. Without agni, even a simple\ndiet cant be digested and converted in to tissue properly. This is the basic rule of health in\nAyurveda.\n\nOne more important factor which directly associated with digestion is : Mind – Body connection\nor Gut-Brain relation. It is scientifically proven that negative aspects like anger, hatred, jealous,\nfear etc. will create stress in the body and will show up as indigestion, acidity, headache or any\nother health problems. Mind and Body are always inter-connected. For healthy body, to have\nhealthy mind is basic condition. The definition of health according to Ayurveda also advocates\nthe same.\n\nThe person who has balanced dosha, dhatu, malas, agni and having blissful or cheerful mind,\nsoul and senses are termed as Healthy person.\n\n Ayurveda diet rules follows nature and natural processes\n All dietetics are understood with its Rasa (tastes) and other characteristics\n There is no vitamin, protein, carbohydrate concept in Ayurveda…but it can be nicely\n defined diet qualities like laghu, guru, snigdha, ruksha etc.\n Diet and its effect on dosha, dhatu, malas and agni are important to understand\n Diet quality and quantity are understood on the basis of individual body constitution\n In short Ayurveda diet rules are more personalized and subjective in nature\n Certain food combinations are not considered good for health. They are known as\n Viruddha-ahar (Incompatible diet). Such viruddha-ahar can be responsible for aama\n production and also many other diseases."

Low\n digestive power can be the cause of aama (toxins – mucus) production, which leads to\n majority of the health problems.\n All available food – grains, vegetables, fruits, spices should be evaluated according to\n ayurvedic knowledge and then applied to an individual as per body type.\n Change of season, age factors, body type, time of the day or night, strength of the\n person, strength of the illness, tolerance for certain food – food combinations etc are\n very important factors to understand.\n\n Eating should be an enjoyable experience, but most people don’t know it.\n\n---------x-------------x-------------x-------------x----------------x----------------x--------------x-------------x--------"
