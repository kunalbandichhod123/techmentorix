    "text": "PREFACE The term “yoga” has many traditional meanings. In Ayurveda, the medical science of India, yoga refers to the “right usage” and “right combination” of herbs. A special combination of substances designed to bring about a specific effect upon the body or mind is thus called a “yoga.” This coordinated or integrated usage of herbs was based upon the ancient Ayurvedic science of herbal energetics. In this is a system for determining the qualities and powers of herbs according to the laws of nature, so that herbs can be used objectively and specifically according to individual conditions. A yogic usage of herbs implies such an harmonic application of the potencies of herbs. In this book, for the first time, this Ayurvedic herbal science is applied to western herbs, as well as to a few major oriental herbs, both Indian and Chinese. It is the purpose of this book not to present Ayurveda in the distance, as something foreign or ancient, but to make it a practically applied system of herbalism. We live in a very special, yet very dangerous time, wherein a new global culture is painfully struggling to be born. It is the challenge of our times to integrate human culture and knowledge. It is essential that this process occurs on the level of the healing sciences also. Healing is always a matter of unification. If our healing knowledge cannot be integrated, how can we as human beings find unity among ourselves? 7"

    "text": "Ayurveda is an eternal system that has already integrated eight limbs of healing within itself, from herbs to surgery to psychology. As such it offers such a point of unification. Its very basis is the spiritual knowledge of the ancient seers of India and the cosmic consciousness in which they lived. This book is not just a presentation of traditional Ayurvedic knowledge. It attempts to show living Ayurveda, its creative and practical application to changing conditions. It is meant as a bridge between east and west. In this regard, it has been a collaboration of an easterner with profound knowledge of the west and a westerner with profound knowledge of the east. It is our deepest wish that it transmits this spirit of integration and collaboration. In the application of Ayurveda to the west, most traditional Ayurvedic medicines cannot be practically used. They may consist of special tropical herbs that are largely inaccessible here, or they may contain special mineral substances that can only be used after long and difficult preparations. Hence this book has arisen as a vehicle to make the healing knowledge of Ayurveda applicable to substances that are accessible and possess few potential side-effects. At the same time, we have also attempted to preserve the integrality of the Ayurvedic healing system. For this we have included special effects of herbs upon the mind, and the deeper psychological and spiritual aspects of healing. Herbalism is part of this broader context of healing and wiuiout addressing these deeper issues of human life, no healing process can really be effective. 8"

    "text": "FOREWORD As an herbalist with over 18 years of experience using Western, Chinese and Ayurvedic herbs, I long ago came to the conclusion that without taking into account the overall energetics of herbs and foods in relation to individual constitutional differences, we are bound for tremendous inconsistency and failure. Such an approach keeps us from drawing broad useful conclusions necessary for the prevention and cure of disease. In this, biochemistry alone is simply not enough. There is much that can be shared between ancient healing systems of Eastern and Western science. Some, imbued with the Western scientific perspective, believe that ours is the most advanced and therefore the only true way. We fail to recognize that there are already fully developed and theoretically articulated medical systems in India and China which have proven themselves effective for more than 3000 years. Ours, however, has only been developed over the past several hundred years. Ayurvedic medicine is certainly one of the oldest systems with a consistent theoretical basis and practical clinical application. Into its ancient well of profound healing wisdom, some of the greatest doctors and sages have poured their finest insights and discoveries. Yet, to fully appreciate the nectar of this Eastern healing wisdom, Westerners need to overcome their literal and linear process of thought to enter into a nonlinear reasoning approach. Therefore, a perspective 10"

The strength of Ayurveda lies in its broad, all-encompassing view of the dynamic interrelationship between organic physiological processes, external factors including climate, life work and that along with internal emotional stages. In contrast, Western science takes a more particular view based upon specific molecular structure and chemistry. It is paradoxical that both could be describing the same condition in such different ways and with such diametrically opposed viewpoints. Today many people are drawn to Oriental healing systems and herbology because these approaches offer the promise of a healing system that is at once powerfully effective and gende with the least danger of side effects. They righdy feel that disease occurs not as an arbitrary phenomenon but for definite reasons which if correctly understood could help to cure and more importantly prevent recurrence. Ayurveda, with its Tridosha or three humours system, is able to provide a complete understanding of the cause of health in terms of a metabolic balance. Disease is simply understood as an imbalance between the nerve energy {vata), catabolic fire energy (fntta) and anabolic nutritive energy (kapha). All foods and experiences have an effect on the overall balance of these respective humours. This is proven by the fact that through adjusting the balance of that only many health problems are alleviated (this is unfortunately still not considered a fact by the majority of Western-trained medical doctors). 11"

    "text": "Herbs are used as “special foods”, serving to eliminate excesses and strengthen deficiencies. While they may possess a powerful nutritive impact on a weakened body their primary action is to stimulate particular organic functions. This is the more illusive energetic aspect of herbs and indeed of all medicines, drugs and foods that need to be understood. Besides the specific function of a medicine or food, there is a more general effect in that for some who are predisposed, it can, broadly speaking, either raise or lower overall metabolism and stimulate or sedate nerve, nutritive or fire energies which comprise the Tridosha humoural system. The fundamental error of western medicine is to treat the disease rather than the patient. If drugs were prescribed sensitively according to the individual nature of each person, as herbs are in Oriental healing systems, many of the side effects that result could be avoided. The value of using herbs and foods lies particularly in their relative non-specific action or their “mildness.” If one misuses an herb, the results are relatively minor and are generally completed in the short span within a day or so that it takes for the body to eliminate the residues of the herb from the system. It is more difficult with synthetic drugs or extracted concentrates. The liver may be unable to fully eliminate a drug from the tissues and cells of the body because it has not figured out how to neutralize it either for assimilation or elimination. Unable to fully process the substance, it is stored in the liver and tissues or circulates in the body, creating a toxic burden that impairs necessary organic physiological processes. Before one can fully realize the healing benefits of Ayurveda or Chinese medicine, both of which are “energetic” systems of healing, all foods and herbs must be classified and 12"

I believe that Dr. David Frawley’s and Dr. Vasant Lad’s book successfully, for the first time, offers such a classification of herbs, including Western herbs and herbs common to both East and West. It is of coincidence that this manuscript should find its way into my hands just at the time that I have nearly completed my own research into classifying Western herbs into the traditional Chinese energetic system. It is also fascinating to see how, in many instances, their method of classification and my own demonstrate the same basic energetic understanding. Dr. David Frawley and Dr. Lad have made a truly powerful and unique contribution to alternative, natural health care by their creation of this important book. It may take a while for the majority of non-Ayurvedically oriented people to see the practical benefits of this original work. However, it is simply the difference between a hit and miss approach, and the development of a consistent and valid herbal healing system. This book for the first time will serve not only to make Ayurvedic medicine of greater practical value to Westerners, but in fact, ultimately advance the whole system of Western herbalism forward into greater effectiveness. I flunk anyone interested in herbs should closely study this book whether their interests lie in Western herbology, traditional Chinese herbology or in Ayurvedic medicine.

    "text": "HERBOLOGY: EAST AND WEST Herbs, both in the east and the west, have been the prime medicinal agent in traditional and holistic therapies. In the East, particularly India and China, an extensive and intricate herbal science has been developed. Originating from the vision of men of spiritual knowledge, herbal medicine was then refined by thousands of years of experience. In this regard Ayurveda includes what is probably the oldest, most visionary, most developed science of herbal medicine in the world. Such a fully developed system does not need refinement but rather translation and adaptation. This book begins with the effort of conveying the ancient science of Ayurvedic herbalism to our own modern needs. Some may be of the opinion that the herbal medicine of India is not relevant to us today. Since its system is ancient and traditional, filled with religion and superstition, we may feel it does not apply. Or we may think its herbs are largely from tropical plants that we can have no access to, or which have little value in our climate, our particular environment. At the same time, many of us realize the necessity of incorporating a spiritual/psychological approach with therapy. Just as physical ailments usually follow emotional imbalances, so we may find the spiritual use of herbs in the Indian tradition of particular importance in our own unbalanced society. Far from being out of touch with today’s world, Ayurvedic herbal medicine is needed now more than ever. While some major herbs in Ayurvedic usage have no equivalents in western herbalism, many common western herbs like bayberry, barberry and calamus are also commonly 15"

Even special Ayurvedic herbs, like ashwagandha and haritaki, may be incorporated into western herbalism, just as ginseng and tang kuei have come from Chinese sources; just as gotu kola, which originally came from India, is now much in use in this country. Many Ayurvedic herbs are common spices–ginger, turmeric, coriander and fenugreek. An impressive pharmacology of Ayurvedic herbs can be put together merely from herbs and spices commonly available in America. Ayurveda means “The Science of Life.” It does not mean Hindu medicine, nor must its herbalism be considered Indian herbalism. It is a science of living that encompasses the whole of life, and which relates the life of the individual to that of the universe. As such it is open to and includes all life, and all methods that bring us into greater harmony with life. Ayurveda is not of the east or the west, of ancient or modern time. It is one with all life, a knowledge that belongs to all living beings–not a system imposed upon them, but a resource to be drawn upon freely and to be adapted to the unique needs of the individual in his or her particular environment. Ayurvedic herbalism gives us not only specific herbs, but a way of understanding all herbs. Ayurveda welcomes the removal of barriers between human beings. The sharing of human healing knowledge must develop for the new age to come. But it must find its place in the immediate world of today. And that is the true purpose of this book. 16"

THE MANIFESTATION OF CONSCIOUSNESS INTO PLANTS Evolution is a manifestation of latent potentials. Within each thing is contained all things. In the seed is the tree; in the tree is the forest. Therefore, intelligence is contained implicitly in the many worlds of nature, not only in our human-centered world. Another way of saying this is that consciousness exists in all forms of life. It is the very basis of creation, the power of evolution. Life, creation, and evolution are the stages in the unfoldment of consciousness. There is nothing in existence that is unfeeling, nothing that is profane or unspiritual, nothing without a unique value in the cosmos. Life is relational, interdependent, interconnective, a system of mutual nourishment and care, not only physically, but also psychologically and spiritually. Consciousness, therefore, is not merely thought, much less intellect or reason. It is the feeling of being alive and being related to all life. Consciousness as pure feeling exists already in the plant and is hidden in the rock, even within the atom itself. Elemental attraction and repulsion are similar to love 17"

For this reason, the ancient seers of India held that the Self alone exists, that unity is the basis of all existence–that the unity of life is the unity of consciousness. By this they meant that every living thing was sentient, that everything was, in the sense of consciousness, human. True humanity, which is humane feeling for all life, is at the heart of all life. Plants and animals sometimes show this sense of caring more than certain humans, who have been hardened in their isolated sense of humanity. It is only when we come to look upon all things as human that we are capable of a truly humane existence. Such a lesson is taught to us by plants and herbs whose existence is still grounded in the unity of nature, through which we may return to understand ourselves better. Man as microcosm contains within himself all the elemental, mineral, vegetable and animal kingdoms. Within the plant is the potential of the human being. Conversely within the human being is the underlying energy structure of the plant. Our nervous system, it could be said, is a tree whose plant-essence is human. Therefore, plants may communicate directly to that essence of feeling which makes a true human being. The Plant Kingdom exists to bring feeling into manifestation. On the plant level, feeling exists in a pure and passive form. The animal and human kingdoms manifest this more actively, more separately, but often with less beauty. Consciousness in plants is on a primal level of unity; therefore it is more psychic, telepathic. 18"

In this manner each kingdom of nature serves to receive and transmit life. This life is implicit in light and in the transmission of stellar or astral forces. The earth, like a gigantic receptor or radio-station, inhales and exhales stellar and cosmic forces, the absorbed essence of which grows and unfolds as life. These forces are not all material, but include subtle energies of an occult or spiritual nature. Plants transmit the vital-emotional impulses, the life-force that is hidden in light. That is the gift, the grace, the power of plants. Plants bring us the love, the nourishing power of the sun, which is the same energy of all the stars, of all light. These cosmic energies emanated by plants thus nourish, sustain and make grow our own astral body. In this way the existence of plants is a great offering, a sacrifice. They offer us not only their own nutritive value but the very light and love from the stars, from the cosmos whose messengers they are. They bring to us the universal light so diat we can enter the universal life. They exist for psychological, as well as physical nourishment. Our feelings, then, are our own inner plants, our own inner flowers. They grow in accordance with our perception of the nature of all life. Creation is light.

These three–light, life and love–are one, each an expression of the other, three dimensions of the same existence. Plants transmute light into life through photosynthesis. The human being transmutes life into consciousness through perception. Through direct perception, the seer is the seen, the observer the observed. The Sanskrit word for the plant osadhi means literally a receptacle or mind, dhi, in which there is burning transformation, osa. In the Vedas this can mean not only plants but all entities in creation. The human being is the plant of consciousness. The plant, which effects a similar process on a “lower level” of evolution, feeds our mind and nervous system to help in this process. As below, so above; all the universe is a metamorphosis of light. In the outer world, a central sun is the source of light and life. In the inner world, a central sun is also the source of life. This inner sun is our true Self, what the ancients called the Purusha or Atman. Plants bring us into communion with the energy of the outer sun, while our inner plant, our nervous system, brings us into communion with the inner sun. Establishing the proper link between the outer plant and the inner plant thus completes the circuit of light and life, and establishes the free flow of awareness in which the mind is liberated–unites the sun with the sun, merges the outer with the inner, creates a festival of delight in living.

Each plant, then, like a mantra, will help to actualize the potential of cosmic life of which it is a representative. For this reason, many ancient people have had reverence for the plant kingdom. It is not a superstitious awe, nor a mere sensitivity to beauty, but a reception of the power that plants bring to us. The force is not received simply through ingesting the plant, but in our total communion with it. The sages of ancient India approached healing and herbs with this same consciousness. Theirs was not a science of experimentation, but a form of direct participation. Experimentation implies distance, a division between observer and observed, subject and object. As a result, it is mediated, measured, translated. In dissecting the corpse, the penetration of the soul is missed. Direct perception, or meditation, is the science of yoga. Yoga allows the essence, the thing-in-itself, to disclose itself. When this happens, a full revelation of material and spiritual potential occurs. The seers, through the yoga of perception, let plants speak to them. And the plants disclosed their secrets–many of which are far more subtle than a chemical analysis could uncover. Approaching plants in the same way today, not as objects for self-aggrandizement but as integral parts of our own unity, the true value of a plant will flourish for our unselfish use. To become a true herbalist, therefore, means to become a seer. This means to be sensitive to the being of the herbs, to commune in receptive awareness with the plant-light of the universe.

    "text": "THE BACKGROUND OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SPIRITUAL BACKGROUND In order to understand the Ayurvedic approach to herbs, one must understand the basic system of Ayurveda, which is a complete healing science, including the physical, psychological and spiritual aspects of life. The ancient seers of India envisioned two fundamental principles behind existence: Purusha, the Primal Spirit, the principle of sentience of consciousness; and the Prakruti, or Great Nature, the principle of creativity. The union of these two, Spirit and Matter, produces all things. Yet these two are also one, the primordial Two-in-One, Consciousness and its creative, executive force, Shiva-Shakti. Within all things is essence, individuality, consciousness–the Purusha. Within all things is also the power of manifestation, the capacity for creative enfoldment– Prakruti. From these two great forces in their initial coming together is born Cosmic Intelligence, Mahat, which contains the seeds of all manifestation. Inherent in Mahat are all the laws of nature. The Cosmic Intelligence also exists in the human being as the intelligence in the individual. As such it is called Buddhi, the means of awakening, developing fully which one becomes enlightened, a Buddha. Buddhi is our capacity for perception, our ability to discern the real from the unreal. 23"

    "text": "But this intelligence, in its evolution into material forms, may give rise to the ego, the sense of separate self, or Ahamkara. It is the principle of division as it is only our sense of a separate ego that divides us from the unity of life. In turn, the ego gives rise to the conditioned mind or conditioned consciousness called Manas, which, as our sense of self-consciousness, creates a protective thought-field around itself in which we become bound. Finally, this links us up with the collective unconscious called China, the storehouse of thoughts of all limited mentalities. Through China we remain under the influence of the latencies, compulsions and drives of the earlier stages of evolution, going all the way back to the animal realm– and before. Ayurveda aims at a life in harmony with Cosmic Intelligence, whereby our own intelligence is perfected, so that through it we can return to unity with nature; and through nature to our true self and spirit, the Purusha. This is the spiritual background of Ayurveda, which is the same as that of yoga, and the basis of Ayurvedic psychology. This requires the awakening of intelligence wherein we go beyond the rule of the ego. The ego is the basis for all deviation from nature. Health is natural, Prakruti. Disease is artificial, Vikruti. Hence, most diseases, except those natural to the course of time, are from the psychological imbalance born of unnecessary self-consciousness. 24"

    "text": "THE THREE GUNAS Prakruti consists of three basic qualities, three prime attributes (called gunas in Sanskrit): Sattva, the principle of light, perception, intelligence and harmony; Rajas, the principle of energy, activity, emotion and turbulence; and lamas, the principle of inertia, darkness, dullness and resistance. While each of these three qualities is necessary in nature, Sattva is the proper quality of the mind. Rajas and Tamas, in the mind, become impurities that weaken our power of perception. Individuals in whom Sattva predominates give value to truth, honesty, humility and the good of all. Those in whom Rajas is strongest value power, prestige, authority and control. Those dominated by lamas remain trapped in fear, servility ignorance, and the forces of decay. Hence, it is important to follow a life-style that is predominately Satt-vic. As these three qualities exist in all nature, it is important to use foods and herbs that are primarily Sattvic in nature. In this light, Ayurveda classifies herbs according to the three gunas. This does not mean that herbs of rajasic or tamasic nature should not be used. As Sattva is also the balance of Rajas and lamas, rajasic herbs may be taken to correct tamasic conditions or vice versa. But sattvic herbs have value in themselves for promoting the development of the mind. 25"

From lamas, consisting of inertia, comes earth. Between Saliva and Rajas arises the subtle but mobile element air. And between Rajas and Tamas arises water, combining mobility with inertia. These elements are the five states of matter: solid, liquid, radiant, gaseous and ethereal. They delineate the five densities of all substances, all visible or invisible matter in the universe. They have psychological correspondences that indicate states of mind and qualities of emotion. The five parts of plants in Ayurveda, pancangam, show how plant structure is related to the five elements. The root corresponds to earth, as the densest and lowest part, connected to the earth. The stem and branches correspond to water, as they convey the water or sap of the plant. The flowers correspond to fire, which manifests light and color. The leaves correspond to air, since through them the wind moves the plant. The fruit corresponds to ether, the subtle essence of the plant. The seed contains all five elements, containing the entire potential plant within itself. THE THREE DOSHAS At the heart of Ayurveda is its concept of the three Doshas, or the diree different basic types of human constitution.

The three Doshas can be recognized by their attributes: Vata is dry, cold, light, mobile, subtle, hard, rough, changeable and clear. It is the most powerful of the Doshas, being the life-force itself, the strongest to create disease. It governs all movement, and carries both Pitta and Kapha. Pitta is hot, light, fluid, subtle, sharp, malodorous, soft and clear. It governs heat, temperature and all chemical reactions. Kapha is cold, wet, heavy, slow, dull, static, smooth, dense and cloudy. It maintains substance, weight and coherence in the body. Vata, in its natural state, maintains energy of will, inhalation, exhalation, movement, the discharge of impulses, equilibrium of the tissues, acuity of the senses. When aggravated, it causes dryness, dark discolora-tions, desire for warmth, tremors, abdominal distention, constipation, loss of strength, insomnia, loss of sensory acuity, incoherency of speech, and fatigue. Pitta, in its normal state, is responsible for digestion, heat, visual perception, hunger, thirst, lustre of skin, intelligence, determination, courage, and softness of the body. When aggravated, it causes yellow discoloration of urine, feces, eyes and skin, and may create hunger, thirst, burning sensations and difficulty in sleeping. Kapha, in its normal state, is responsible for firmness and stability, maintenance of bodily fluids, lubrication of joints, 28"

Western Medicine, and to some extent, western herbalism, lacks this science of individual constitution. The same disease may occur in different constitutions, and as such must be treated differendy Asthma, for example, may be due to deranged Kapha, excessive water in the lungs; deranged Vata, nervous hypersensitivity of the lungs; or deranged Pitta, an accumulation of damp-heat in the lungs. The same treatment cannot work in every case. Merely to know that a certain herb “works on a certain disease may not reveal a definitive cure. On the other hand, the same constitutional problem, the same aggravated dosha, may give rise to various diseases, and as such all can be treated the same way–by decreasing the aggravated dosha. High Vata, for example, may manifest as sciatic pain, arthritis, constipation, headaches, dry skin, gas and indigestion, all of which can be relieved by a single line of treatment. Knowing which disease an herb treats gives us one reference line. Knowing the constitution on which it works yields yet another cross reference line. Considering both we are much more able to pinpoint a truly effective treatment. 37"

It also contains a knowledge of special herbs and substances (minerals and metals) that work on the subtler tissues, including the nerve and reproductive tissues. The semen or reproductive tissue is the essence of all bodily tissues and contains within itself not only the power of reproduction, but also that of rejuvenation. The essence of the semen, the cream of the body, is called Ojas, which means “that which invigorates.” Ojas is thus the essence of the body, the substance of all hormonal secretions, and supports the auto-immune system. The plant, like the human being, and the universe itself, is similarly composed of seven dhatus or seven planes. The juice of the plant is its plasma. The resin of the plant is its blood. The softwood is muscle. The gum is its fat. The bark is its bones. The leaves are its marrow and nerve-tissue. The flowers and fruit are its reproductive tissue. The flowering tree shows these tissues in their most developed state. The tree is to the plant world what the human being is to the animal kingdom. The Dhatus of the plant work upon the corresponding Dhatus of the human body: its juice works upon our plasma; resin upon our blood; softwood upon our muscles; gum upon our fat; bark upon our bones; leaves upon our marrow/nerves; flowers/fruit upon our reproductive organs. The seeds of plants thus treat congenital diseases and dysfunctions by virtue of their affinity with our own seed and congenital root. 38"

There are special herbs, like ashwagandha, which contain high amounts of Ojas, and special ways to prepare herbs which help to transmit them directly. Mantra and meditation are part of this process.

In Ayurveda this life-force, called Prana, has five functional variations. Herbs are classified according to which of these Pranas they work on. 1. PRANA: centered in the brain, it moves downward, governing inhalation and swallowing. It relates to intelligence, power of sensory and motor functions, and primarily to tne nervous and respiratory systems. 2. VyANA: centered in the heart, it acts throughout the body, governing the circulatory system and the movement of joints and muscles. 3. SAMANA: centered in the small intestine, it governs the digestive system. 4. UDANA: centered in the throat, it governs speech, energy, will, effort, memory, exhalation. 5. APANA: centered in the lower abdomen it governs all downward discharges of feces, urine, semen, menstrual fluid and the fetus. These five Pranas are commonly called the five Vayus (Vayu means air or motivating force). They are a fivefold division of the life-force and its functional differentiation in its energization of the nervous system. 41"

Herbs are classified according to the bodily systems of channels they affect. These are as follows: 1. Pranavaha srotas: the channels which carry the breath or prana. These are similar to the respiratory system. 2. Annavaha srotas: the channels that carry food, which are essentially the same as the digestive system. 3. Ambuvaha srotas: the channels which carry water or which regulate the water metabolism, which are another aspect of the digestive system. These first three systems of channels govern the intake of substances into the body. The next seven supply the seven Dhatus or bodily tissues. 4. Rasavaha srotas: the channels that carry the plasma portion of the blood and tissue. They are related specifically to the lymphatic system, but also to aspects of the circulatory system. 5.

AGNI AND PLANTS Ayurveda views the health of the body as the functioning of a biological fire governing metabolism. It is called agni. Agni is not simply a symbol for the power of digestion. In the broader sense, it is the creative flame that works behind all life, building up the entire universe as a stage by stage unfoldment of itself, which, thereby, contains within itself the key to all transformations. Agni is present not only in human beings but in all nature. It has a special abode in plants, which contain the agni of photosynthesis. 46"

    "text": "When agni is strong, food is digested properly toxins of various kinds, largely from undigested food particles, (called ama in Ayurveda), accumulate and breed disease. Plants contain agni, through which they digest sunlight and produce life. Herbs can transmit their agni to us, their capacity to digest and transform, and this may augment our own power of digestion, or give us the capacity to digest substances we normally cannot. The agni of plants can feed our agni. Through this interconnection, we join ourselves with the cosmic agni, the creative force of life and healing. The agni from plants is magnetically attracted by its opposite nature to the negative life-force of the ama, or various toxic accumulations in our body. The result is their neutralization and a restoration of harmony. Herbs can be used to supplement agni and thereby restore our autoimmune system. This restores the power of our aura, which is nothing more than the glow of our agni. By their very nature the right herbs and spices can feed agni, directly strengthening the basic energy of body-mind, allowing for the right digestion, not only of food but also experience. 47"

    "text": "HERBAL ENERGETICS Ayurveda approaches herbs through a science of energetics. The properties of herbs are related systematically according to their taste, elements, heating or cooling effects, effect after digestion and other special potencies they may possess. As distinct from the complexity of chemical analysis, which often loses us in a maze of details, this simple system of energetics clarifies the basic properties of herbs. It gives us a structure in which they can easily be identified and understood. Therefore they can be used for the individual constitution and condition. This system of herbal energetics is the main factor in the Ayurvedic understanding of herbs. Chinese herbalism has a similar system of taste and energy. The lack of such a system in western herbalism has placed it at a disadvantage. In this book we try to explain the action of many western herbs according to the energetics of Ayurveda. Hopefully, we may help to close the above-mentioned gap and facilitate herbal usage on an Oriental level of sophistication. Understanding the principles of energetics is essential for treatment. TASTE (RASA) Ayurveda states that the taste of an herb is not incidental, but is an indication of its properties. Different tastes possess different effects. 48"

    "text": "Usually we do not connect taste with therapeutic property. With foods we consider taste for enjoyment value. In western herbalism, we note the taste of an herb more as a means of identification rather than as a means of understanding its effects. There is the general recognition that spicy, pungent herbs tend to be heating and stimulating, or that bitter herbs help reduce fever, but this has not become the basis for any classification of herbs by taste. The Sanskrit word for taste, rasa, has many meanings. All of them help us understand the importance of taste in Ayurveda. Rasa means “essence.” Taste thus indicates the essence of a plant, and so is perhaps the prime factor in understanding its qualities. Rasa means “sap” so that the taste of an herb reflects the properties of the sap which invigorates it. Rasa means “appreciation,” “artistic delight” a “musical note.” Thus taste communicates feeling, which again is the essence of the plant. Through it the beauty and power of the plant can be perceived. Rasa means “circulation” “to feel lively/” “to dance,” all of which is reflected in the energizing power of taste. Taste directly affects our nervous system through the Prana, the life-force in the mouth, which is connected to the Prana in the brain. Taste stimulates nerves, awakens mind and senses to make us lively. Thus taste sets our own rasa or vital fluid in motion. Through stimulating Prana, particularly the gastric nerves, taste affects agni and enhances the power of digestion. It is the good taste of food that is necessary to awaken our agni for proper digestion. 49"

    "text": "For this reason, bland food may not be nourishing in spite of its vitamin or mineral content. Without stimulating agni, there is no real power of digestion. Ayurvedic medicine has, therefore, always included the science of cooking with the right spices. Together, they are part of the field of Ayurvedic herbal science. When we are sick, we lose our sense of taste and our appetite. Taste, appetite, and power of digestion are related. Lack of taste indicates fever, disease, low agni, high ama. To improve agni and eliminate disease, it is necessary to improve our sense of taste. This is why spices are such important Ayurvedic herbs. Desire for tasty food indicates hungry agni or disease. The problem is that we have perverted our sense of taste with artificial substances. Taste is the sensory quality that belongs to the element of water. Plants are the life-form belonging to the element of water. Taste thus reflects the energies and elements that operate in a particular herb. Cloud water originally has no taste, but all tastes are latent in it.These are gathered as it falls, as it passes through the five elements in the atmosphere and takes on their qualities. Ayurveda recognizes six main tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent. These derive from five elements; each taste is composed of two elements. Sweet taste is composed of earth and water; sour of earth and fire; salty of water and fire; pungent of fire and air; bitter of air and ether; and astringent of earth and air. 50"

Pungent is the same as spicy or acrid, and is often aromatic. Bitter is of bitter herbs like gentian or golden seal. Astringent taste has a constricting quality as herbs that contain tannin, like oak bark. Though the six tastes transmit the properties of the five elements, they are all based on the element of water, which manifests them. It is only when the tongue is wet that we recognize taste. ENERGY (VIRYA) Virya is the energy, potency or power of herbs, designated in Ayurveda as heating or cooling. Herbs through their taste tend to heat the body or cool it and this produces the most basic energizing effect upon the system. Pungent taste, as is commonly known in hot peppers, chilis, ginger and other hot spices, has a heating effect. Things sour or acid in taste like citrus or products of fermentation like wine, yogurt or pickles, are heating. Fermentation creates combustion which releases heat. Salt is also heating, which we can experience by the burning sensation it produces on cuts or sores. Sweet taste is cooling, as sugar counteracts burning sensations in the body. Bitter and cold are often synonymous, as in bitter herbs like gentian and golden seal which reduce fever and inflammation. Astringent taste has a constricting effect, which is the action of something cold like ice, as in such astringent substances like alum, oak bark or witch hazel. 51"

Cooling herbs are refreshing, enlivening, and promote tissue firmness. They are calming and clearing to Pitta and to the blood, but generally increase Vata and Kapha. “Heating or cooling energy” means that these substances contain, respectively, the energies of fire or water {agni or soma). Through their energy the six tastes fall into two groups: 1) pungent, sour and salty cause heat and increase Pitta; and 2) sweet, astringent and bitter cause cold and decrease Pitta. Energy, virya, tells us the effect of an herb on Pitta dosha. Pungent is the most heating taste, followed by sour and then salty. Bitter is the most cooling, followed by astringent and then sweet. Other Twofold Distinctions Another important twofold distinction of tastes, though not an independent principle like energy is whether herbs are drying or moistening. The main quality of Vata dosha is dryness, while that of Kapha is wetness. Tastes that are drying (bitter, pungent and astringent) increase Vata and decrease Kapha. Those that are moistening (sweet, salty and sour) increase Kapha and decrease Vata. 52"

Drying herbs are composed mainly of t_he element air, while moistening herbs are composed mainly of water. They produce the effects of their element. Another, but less important, twofold distinction is heavy or light– whether herbs tend to increase lightness or heaviness in the body. This distinction is similar to drying or moistening. Sour taste, owing to its heating potency and its power to increase digestion, tends to be light. Astringent taste, owing to its constricting effect upon the tissues, tends to be heavy. Sweet is the heaviest taste, followed by salty and then astringent. Bitter is the lightest taste, followed by pungent and then sour. Tastes that are heavy in quality promote weight and firmness in the body. Those light in quality cause loss of weight, but are stronger in stimulating digestion. VIPAKA, POST-DIGESTIVE EFFECT The six tastes are reduced to three in their post-digestive effect, vipaka. Sweet and salty tastes, have a sweet vipaka, sour has a sour vipaka, while bitter, astringent and pungent possess a pungent vipaka. These post-digestive effects relate to processes of absorption and elimination; the final outcome of digestion. The first stage of digestion is in the mouth and stomach; moistening, dominated by the sweet taste. The second stage of digestion is in the stomach and small intestine; heating, dominated by the 53"

Herbs, particularly in the long-term usage, tend to aggravate the dosha whose vipaka they possess. Sweet and salty substances promote salivary and other Kapha secretions. Sour herbs promote stomach acid, bile, and other manifestations of Pitta. Bitter, pungent and astringent herbs increase dryness and gas in the colon, thus aggravating Vata. Sweet and sour vipakas, owing to their moistening property, allow for easy and comfortable discharge of urine, feces and intestinal gas. Pungent vipakas, from their drying property, create difficulty and discomfort in discharge of waste products. Sweet vipaka also promotes the secretion of Kapha, including semen and sexual secretions, and allows for comfortable discharge. Sour vipaka increases Pitta and acid formation in the body, and reduces semen and sexual secretions (though it promotes the other tissue-elements of the body). Pungent vipaka tends to cause gas, constipation and painful urination. It reduces semen and sexual secretions and gives difficulty and discomfort in their discharge. Sweet and also sour vipakas aggravate Kapha, while they alleviate Vata. Pungent vipaka aggravates Vata, while it alleviates Kapha. Sour vipaka aggravates Pitta while sweet vipaka alleviates it. Pungent vipaka tends to aggravate Pitta over a period of time. 54"

PRABHAVA, SPECIAL POTENCY Taste, energy and post-digestive effect are only a general schemata for understanding the properties of herbs. Herbs also possess subder and more specific qualities that transcend thought and that cannot be placed into a system of energetics. Prabhava can be called “the special potency” of the herb. It is its uniqueness, apart from any general rules about it. Some herbs possess a property at variance with its basic energetics. Basic, for instance, which though classified as heating in energy, helps bring down almost any kind of fever, even those caused by heat. Some herbal properties, like strong purgative action, are also not defined by energetics alone. Other herbs, sharing the same energetics, may differ widely in special potencies; one may be a purgative, while another may not be. All this is prabhava. Prabhava includes the occult properties of plants, their capacity to affect the mind and psyche on a direct and subtle level. The special and thought-transcending power of mantras and rituals, and the external use of gemstones to effect inner changes are also prabhava. Prabhava includes auric action, astral effect, magnetic effect, and radiation. Even some diseases like cancer originate owing to a kind of prabhava or special predisposition whose etiology transcends thought and the reasoning of the materialistic mind. 55"

It understands the value and the limitation of systems, and only uses them as a guide, not as a rigid rule. This spiritual orientation, one could say, is the prabhava of Ayurveda, the special power which can be learned from it. While the prabhava of the plants of India is largely known, that of western plants is largely unknown or forgotten. Certainly our American Indians had similar knowledge but lost it during the depredations of the white man. We should apply the science of energetics to western herbs with care and consistency and the belief that exceptions also make the rule. DESCRIPTION OF THE SIX TASTES (Quotes from Charak Samhita XVI. 43.) I. Sweet “The sweet taste (as it is of the same nature as the human body, whose tissues taste sweet), promotes the growth of all bodily tissues and Ojas. Aiding in longevity, it is soothing to the five sense organs and the mind, and gives strength and good complexion. Sweet taste alleviates Pitta, Vata and the effects of poison. It also relieves thirst and burning sensation and it promotes the health and growth of skin and hair; it is good for the voice and energy. “Sweet taste is nourishing, vitalizing, gives contentment, adds bulk to the body, creates firmness. It rebuilds weakness, 56"

It increases semen, milk and nerve tissue, and promotes tissue regeneration internally or externally. It is demulcent and emollient, moistening, softening and soothing. Sweet Herbs: Sweet taste is found in herbs that contain sugars, starches or mucilage. It includes bland, starchy and pleasant tastes, and may be mixed with less agreeable secondary tastes. It is relatively uncom-mon.Typical sweet herbs include almonds, comfrey root, dates, fennel, flaxseed, licorice, maidenhair fern, marshmallow, psyllium, raisins, sesame seeds, slippery elm, and Solomon’s seal. Sweet taste in herbs can be increased by processing herbs with various forms of raw sugar, honey, or cooking them in milk. 57"

Sour Herbs: Sour taste occurs largely from the presence of various acids in plants, like acid fruit. Sour taste is rarer than sweet. Typical sour herbs include hawthorn berries, lemon, lime, raspberries and rose hips.Sour taste in herbs can be increased by preparing herbs in fermentation as herbal wines or as tinctures in alcohol (whose taste is sour).

It is demulcent, softening bodily tissues and it is calming, mildly sedative. It aids in tissue growth throughout the body and promotes water retention. Salty Herbs: Salty taste is really not a plant but a mineral taste, so it is very rare in plants as a primary taste.Typical salty substances include epsom salt, Irish moss, kelp, rock salt, sea salt and seaweed. Salty taste in herbs can be increased by adding salt to herbal preparations. IV.

Pungent and bitter sometimes combine as with motherwort, mug-wort, wormwood and yarrow. Such herbs have a strong effect on Kapha. Pungent and astringent combine occasionally, as with bayberry, cinnamon or sage. They also work on Kapha. Bitter and astringent often combine, as in many diuretics.

For herbs of multiple tastes the energy and post-digestive effect become important for determining their effect. Herbs of multiple 65"

However, particular foods are prescribed therapeutically as herbs, or in combination with herbs. Such substances include milk, honey, ghee, raisins, dates and almonds.

Food deals with the “grosser nutrition” of the body; herbs give subtle nutrition and stimulation to the deeper tissues and organs. Tastes and Emotions Emotions also have a certain taste or flavor and affect the body according to their qualities. There are bitter emotions like grief, or astringent emotions like fear–these aggravate Vata. There are sour emotions like envy, or pungent emotions like anger–these aggravate Pitta. And there are sweet emotions like desire, or salty emotions like greed–these aggravate Kapha. Emotions can have the same effect upon the body as wrong foods, drugs, alcohol, or infections.

    "text": "MANAGEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTION (DOSHA) In Ayurveda, patients are treated according to their constitution. The treatment is not symptomatic, but goes to the root of the individual’s physiological and psychological being. The purpose of Ayurveda is not to cure a particular disease, but to bring each individual to his or her own natural self-harmony This goes to the heart of all diseases that are manifested in the individual. In treating the “disease” the healer is only working generally or superficially. Knowledge of constitution is the key for a holistic and integral health care, the true basis of any preventive medicine. In differentiating diseases according to constitution, we understand why different herbs treat the same disease or why certain herbs treat many diseases. In Ayurveda we treat the individual constitution by its predominate Dosha. Generally speaking, we treat the Dosha with herbs and therapies of an opposite nature to its qualities. Heating and drying therapies are used for Kapha constitution which tends towards cold and dampness. Heating and moistening are used for Vata that tends towards cold and dryness; and cooling and drying is used for Pitta whose properties are hot and moist. However, sometimes herbs that increase a particular Dosha may help in treating it. Some herbs that increase Kapha, like licorice, in liquifying excess or accumulated Kapha by the moistening effect of the herb, facilitate its elimination from 68"

It may be helpful for short term usage or as balanced out by other herbs more opposite to the Dosha in properties. Herbal therapies and formulas must be examined as a whole, according to their complete strategy and final outcome. Individual Constitution and Disease Condition Individual constitution generally represents the disease-proneness of the individual; for example, Kapha people tend to suffer from Kapha-type diseases like colds and congestive disorders. However, individuals can also suffer from diseases of a different nature than their constitution, like a Kapha-type common cold suffered by a Pitta person. So we must note not only the nature of the individual but also that of the disease and treat both. Individual constitution is called Prakruti in Sanskrit, which means “nature.” Disease condition is called Vikruti, which means “deviation from nature.” Ascertaining an individual’s constitution depends more on innate factors like the build of the body or on lifelong tendencies and appetites. Ascertaining the disease condition relates more to symptoms, which may be temporary. As long as our herbal treatment deals mainly with acute, temporary or surface conditions then determination of individual constitution is not that important. We can more simply and directly treat the disease condition. But for deeper and more chronic diseases, for long term treatment, 69"

MANAGEMENT OF KAPHA Kapha, in which the element of water predominates, is cold, moist, slow and heavy in attribute. Therefore, it is treated by a warming, drying, lightening and stimulating therapy. Tastes that treat Kapha are pungent, bitter and astringent; they are all drying and lightening, catabolic in their actions. Pungent taste, which is also heating, is exactly opposite Kapha in its qualities, and so is most specifically prescribed in treating Kapha conditions. Therapies that treat Kapha are reducing therapies. They are usually given along with fasting or a light that. Their action is to reduce weight, the earth element in the body, and to dispel water. Water can be eliminated from the body in various ways. The most direct way is through the kidneys, via urination, in diuresis. Hence, the diuretic method of therapy, increasing kidney function, is a major anti-Kapha therapy. It helps dispel edema, water stagnation in the body, and helps reduce fat, which is also usually an excess of water. Diuretic herbs, however, do not go to the root of Kapha disorders. Kapha’s main site of accumulation is in the lungs and stomach, which diuretics working on the kidneys may not directly affect. 70"

Sweating is another major anti-Kapha therapy. It is effective in dispelling common colds and flus, which are generally a Kapha condition, and it also works to dispel water from the surface, beneath the skin, the face and the upper portions of the body. It is useful in the initial stages of febrile diseases, asthma, bronchitis, lymphatic congestion. Water also exists in the body as phlegm or mucus, which is the basic form of Kapha in the body. This can accumulate in the lungs and stomach, and spread to various other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Water may also go under the skin, and create various tumors, generally benign. Phlegm can lodge anywhere in the body and block the channels of circulation, srotas, and create various diseases, like heart disease owing to high cholesterol. To dispel Kapha in the form of phlegm and mucus, expectorant or mucus dispelling herbs are used. According to Ayurveda, the strongest way to reduce Kapha is by using emetic therapy. Kapha exists primarily in the lungs and stomach, and from there it can best be expelled from the body by therapeutic vomiting. This is an extension of the diaphoretic and expectorant method. Kapha, whose energy is sinking, is dispelled by upward moving and dispersing action. Yet, to be effective, therapeutic vomiting must be done with the right preparations and conditions. It should only be administered by those who have special knowledge or training in this therapy. Vomiting induced at the wrong time, 71"

It is this weakness of the digestive fire (the fire element) that creates the increase of water (Kapha), which leads to various diseases. In this regard, herbs which promote digestion, stimulant and carminative herbs, are another major anti-Kapha therapy. They are basically hot, pungent herbs that strengthen Agni, increase metabolism, circulation, and promote activity that breaks up the inertia of Kapha. This is why spices are good for Kapha constitution. Bitter herbs, particularly those called bitter tonics, are the strongest herbs to reduce fat in the body and thereby also serve strongly to decrease Kapha. Bitter herbs are composed mainly of air and so they bring about weight reduction, the decrease of the earth element in the body which is also Kapha. Bitter herbs reduce craving for sweets and promote spleen-pancreas function. Laxative and purgative herbs, herbs which promote evacuation, may similarly help reduce the earth element in the body and so reduce Kapha (though they should be used only where conditions warrant it).

Most hot stimulants possess expectorant action and some possess diaphoretic action. Most diaphoretics are also expectorants. It is the same principle at work; increase fire, reduce water. Herbal medicine is a most effective therapy in reducing Kapha. This is because the predominant tastes of herbs are bitter, astringent and pungent, the three tastes that reduce Kapha. Very few herbs increase Kapha. Even sweet, tonic and demulcent herbs may be useful in liquifying Kapha to aid in its expulsion from the body. Herbs are a good basis for the lightening, reducing and detoxifying therapy used to treat Kapha. MANAGEMENT OF PITTA Pitta, which mainly consists of the element of fire, is primarily hot in attribute. Therefore, it is treated with a cooling or heat-dispelling therapy It is also moist, light and mobile, so it can benefit from therapies which are drying, nutritive or calming. The cooling therapy, however, should be given first whenever Pitta is to be treated. Tastes that treat Pitta are sweet, astringent and bitter–all cooling in nature. Bitter taste, being the coldest and most drying of the tastes, is strongest in reducing Pitta.

Most conditions of bodily heat, fever, inflammation, infection or acidity also relate generally to Pitta. When deranged, Pitta will manifest itself in the above aberrations. But Pitta or Agni may be obstructed or moved by Vata and Kapha. This gives heat symptoms like fever, but they must be treated by alleviating the Dosha causing the problem. We cannot simplistically treat all heat as Pitta. Heat may be dispelled from the body in various ways. We must determine the nature, depth and location of its manifestation to discover the appropriate treatment for it. Surface heat, as in fever due to colds or temporary (not necessarily chronic or deep-seated) inflammatory skin conditions, is usually treated using diaphoretic herbs. Warming diaphoretics increase heat and cause sweating, thereby aggravating Pitta. But there is also a class of cooling diaphoretics that dispel heat and eliminate Pitta through sweating. For surface heat due to Pitta, Pitta-colds etc., these are appropriate. Heat in the blood, which is found in many inflammatory and infectious conditions, sores, ulcers, boils, infections, etc., can be treated with alterative herbs. These are usually bitter or astringent anti-Pitta herbs, often possessing antibacterial properties and promoting healing. Where blood heat leads to bleeding, as is its tendency, astringent or hemostatic herbs can be used, those whose taste and energy alleviate Pitta. 74"

    "text": "For the highest heat, fever and Pitta-conditions, bitter fire-purging and heat-dispelling herbs are used. In western herbalism these are called bitter tonics. They are the strongest herbs for cooling Pitta, for sedating and detoxifying the liver, and for reducing deep-seated heat/fever in the interior of the body. Ayurveda calls them febrifuges or antipyretic herbs, and advises the use of bitter taste for bringing down fevers. Their action is similar to alteratives but they are stronger, reaching deeper tissues than blood and lymph. Purgatives, herbs which promote excretion, those whose energy is cooling, are another strong anti-Pitta therapy. When the heat attribute of Pitta is high, or where there is high fever, this heat accumulates in the gastrointestinal tract and dries up the stool causing constipation. Then purgation can directly alleviate Pitta, and it is in this condition that the strongest purgatives tend to be used. When, however, the liquid attribute of Pitta is high, which is generally more common, there is diarrhea or loose motion of a heat nature. In this instance, such cooling purgatives may still be used, as the cause again is heat. Ayurveda considers the purgative method (virechana karma) to be the strongest for eliminating excess Pitta from the body, as it clears Pitta from its site of accumulation in the small intestine. It is the natural course for the elimination of Pitta, but again may require supervision, as it is a strong therapy.` Usually heat is dispelled downwards from the body. Heat rises and expands and so it is dispelled by a sinking and contracting action. For this reason, not only purgative action but also diuretic action, is also helpful for relieving Pitta. 75"

Most cases of emaciation, dehydration and deficiency of vital fluids are this kind of Vata problem. “Obstructive -void’ refers to Vata derangement caused by blockage of the channels (mar-gavarodha) by accumulated Vata, which may also gather with it Ama, Kapha or Pitta. This includes such diseases as arthritis and rheumatism as well as many digestive problems of abdominal distention, gas and constipation. Such accumulated Vata may result in obesity or what is called “anabolic Vata.” Vata-causcd deficiency is treated with a tonic therapy of mainly sweet and nutritive herbs and foods. In obstructed Vata we must remove the obstruction and in this a tonic therapy does not work. A tonic therapy would only feed the obstruction and increase the stagnation of Vata causing more pain and discomfort. Hence we use pungent herbs to clear out the obstruction and so alleviate Vata. Pungent taste has a stimulating effect on Vata and can thereby help move and dispel accumulated and stagnant Vata. This, in the short term, reduces Vata; but in the long term, after the blockage in the movement of Vata is removed, it will tend to increase Vata. Pungent taste is the hottest taste. It is useful in helping to dispel the cold attribute of Vata. It aggravates Vata only in terms of dryness. When cold is the main Vata attribute to be combatted, we can use pungent taste. When dryness and dehydration are pronounced, it is generally contraindicated. 77"

Agni is hot, dry, light, clear, fragrant (aromatic) and pure. To treat Ama, it is necessary to increase Agni. Psychologically, Ama arises from the holding of negative emotions. Negative emotions quench the mental Agni or clarity of mind. As a result, the physical Agni is also reduced. Undigested experiences become toxic like undigested food. Symptoms of Ama include loss of taste and appetite, indigestion, tongue-coating, bad breath, loss of strength, heaviness, lethargy, and obstructions of channels and vessels. Other symptoms are accumulation of waste-materials, bad odor of body urine or feces, deep, heavy or dull pulse, lack of attention, loss of clarity depression, irritability and obstruction of other Doshas.

They purify the blood, removing toxins, and tend to have anti-infectious, antibacterial action. 2. They help heal and resolve sores, boils, tumors and many kinds of cancer. 3. Typical alteratives work through cooling the blood and so also dispel fevers, reduce Pitta and detoxify the liver. 4. They may be used externally on wounds, sores, ulcers, etc. and have anti-inflammatory and vulnerary properties. 5. With their detoxifying action they help kill worms and parasites, particularly those that invade the blood. 6. They work well in infectious, contagious diseases and epidemics. Alteratives treat flus, especially those with high fever, sore throat, earache, etc.; in this regard they are a degree stronger than cooling diaphoretics. They treat acne, dermatitis, boils and inflammatory skin conditions. They can be used on herpes and venereal diseases, as well as cancer.

Typical alteratives (cooling): aloe vera, blue flag, burdock, chaparral, dandelion, echinacea, indigo, manjishta, neem, plantain, pokeroot, red clover, sandalwood and yellow dock. Many hot, pungent herbs possess a cleansing action in the blood, as well as promoting circulation and resolving blood clots. They are detoxifying, often antibacterial, and help reduce fevers by destroying the toxin that produces them. They also have an antiparasitical or worm-killing action. Hot pungent alteratives and cold bitter alteratives can be combined to strengthen the detoxifying power of each. They can be used together in conditions of high Ama. This is true even in Vata or Pitta constitutions– until the Ama is reduced (as in periodic or malarial fevers). Generally speaking, however, cooling alteratives are good for Pitta, heating alteratives are good for Vata, and both work well on Kapha. Cooling alteratives that have a strong antibacterial or antibiotic effect, like golden seal and wild indigo, if used too long or in excess, can have the same detrimental effect upon the body as antibiotic drugs, destroying the good as well as the bad bacteria in the body, thus weakening the immune system and causing further infections.

It includes all parasites, bacterial, fungal and yeast infections, which were accessible to the subtle vision of the yogis. Anthelmintics are useful in these conditions as well. They have value in treating the wide-spread yeast infection of Candida albicans, and related food allergy problems. Parasitical infections are treated like Ama, as undigested food while it stagnates will eventually breed some sort of parasite. They are treated with a detoxifying therapy; tonification would only feed the infestation. For this reason anthelmintic herbs have an emaciating effect upon the body and can 88"

Ayurveda identifies parasites with the aggravated Dosha through which they are manifested. Kafha-type parasites reside primarily in mucus or phlegm; Pitta-type parasites in the blood; and Vata-type parasites are found in the feces. Care must be taken to treat the aggravated Dosha as well as the specific parasites. Antiparasitical action is possessed mainly by pungent or bitter-tasting herbs, yet it is often more a matter of special potency Prabhava, than of general energetics.

Astringent taste may be differentiated from astringent action in the following way: astringent tasting herbs have astringent action while herbs of other tastes may also have astringent effects upon the body. Astringent tasting herbs are mainly used symptomaticaUy, as in stopping bleeding or stopping diarrhea. Yet they often do not correct the condition from which the problem arises. Other herbs of different tastes may, in correcting conditions, alleviate these symptoms also. Diarrhea, for example, may be due to poor absorption in the small intestine. An astringent taste herb like alum or raspberry may suppress the symptom, but will not improve absorption (astringent taste is heavy and difficult to digest). In this regard, an herb like nutmeg, which is pungent and astringent, and which contains heating and digestion promoting action along with astringent action, is more the herb of choice. It may not always be good to suppress discharges. Diarrhea caused by Atria may be the body’s way of naturally cleansing itself. To suppress such diarrhea with astringent taste herbs would be to hold the toxins in the body and cause further complications. The correct treatment in this case would be to promote the diarrhea with laxatives until the Atna is dispelled. Astringents would only be employed if the diarrhea continued beyond the point of cleansing.

Not all of these herbs are astringent in taste. Hemostatic herbs stop bleeding, usually by cooling the blood. They are related to alterative herbs, blood-purifiers. Since they are mainly anti-Pitta in action, t_hey can aggravate Vata. Their taste is usually astringent or bitter. Typical hemostatic herbs include agrimony bistort, cattail, golden seal, hibiscus, manjishta, marshmallow, mullein, nettle, plantain, red raspberry, saffron, self-heal, shepherd’s purse, turmeric, white oak and yarrow. Some hot pungent herbs have a hemostatic action, particularly where bleeding is caused by cold, as in some Vata or Kapha conditions. Such herbs include black pepper, cayenne, cinnamon and ginger. These stop bleeding in short term usage but in longer usage may promote bleeding by heating the blood. Bitter tonics and alterative herbs, which generally cool blood and Pitta, may help stop bleeding by their cooling action even without any more specific hemostatic properties. 91"

Astringent herbs promote the healing of tissues, but do not actually promote the increase of tissue. This drying action can have not only a healing, but also a wasting effect. Wrong or excessive use of astringent herbs may aggravate Vata. This can cause constipation, gas pain, muscle spasms and nervousness. For this reason, astringent herbs are often used synergistically with nutritive or tonic herbs. The nutritive herbs build up the tissue and the astringents give it firmness and help hold it in the body. Herbs that combine astringent and tonic action are thereby powerful rejuvenatives like amalaki, bibhitaki and haritaki, three of Ayurveda’s most powerful regenerative herbs. BITTER TONIC AND ANTIPYRETIC HERBS The Ayurvedic concept of tonic herbs is different than that of most American and European herbal treatments. In western herbalism, the term tonic, which implies an agent that nurtures and strengthens the body, is usually given to cold bitter herbs like gentian or golden seal. These are thought to increase vitality by stimulating digestion. By increasing nutrition the herbs are thought to strengthen the body and its organs, while at the same time giving proper tone to muscles and tissues. This herbal action is said to increase the elimination of toxins, waste-products, and to purify the blood. Tonic herbs are thus prescribed for any convalescent or run-down patient. 93"

Bitter taste, as indicated in our chapter on herbal energetics, is the coldest, most drying, most depletive and reductive of tastes. It is not tonic in the sense of being nutritive–promoting tissue growth or building up the body Its effects are of a catabolic or reducing nature, detoxifying, promoting the depletion or elimination of tissue, while depressing or sedating most of the organic functions of the body. Its proper use is more in reducing toxins and excesses, not in building-up deficiencies. Bitter herbs are part of a purification, sedation, heat-dispelling or reducing therapy, which usage they also share in Chinese medicine. Ayurveda believes that bitter herbs stimulate digestion, but only in small amounts, and mainly for patients suffering from heat, fever or high Pitta conditions. They are not often prescribed for the chronically weak or emaciated. Higher dosages are thought to depress digestion, weaken assimilation and derange peristalsis. Bitter herbs, by their nature as air and ether, dry up the tissues and vital fluids and may cause rigidity of the muscles or even muscle spasms. Rather than promote proper tone of muscles, organs and tissues, under many conditions bitter herbs will reduce it. While most western herbalism prescribes these herbs for convalescence and debility, Ayurveda often regards them as unhelpful in such conditions. Many cases of weakness and convalescence are Vata in nature, conditions of chill, fluid deficiency and the wasting away of bodily tissues. They 94"

It is mainly in conditions of lingering fever, remittent or intermittent, or in the debility following a fever or high Pitta state that they can be strengthening. Perhaps earlier western herbalists used bitter herbs as tonics for convalescence in patients of Pitta constitution who suffered from febrile diseases, or had an overdose of toxins from heavy meat-eating, drinking of alcohol and so on. Modern vegetarians, particularly those of Vata constitution, would be weakened by over-use of bitter herbs as tonics. Tonic herbs in Ayurveda are generally sweet, nutritive substances that build tissue, strengthen vitality, increase vital fluids, improve sexual energy and aid longevity. They are considered in a separate section on tonic herbs. Bitter herbs can deplete vitality, depress sexual energy and promote the aging-process. We refer to them in this book as bitter tonics mainly for the sake of convenience, as they are known by this term. We also call them “antipyretics” or herbs which dispel heat, fire and fever. One could say, with some justification, that these bitter tonics are tonics for Pitta, as they are the strongest herbs to reduce and regulate its function. But their action should not be confused with tonics that are nutritive and rejuvenative. Bitter tonics are, nonetheless, very important herbal medicines.

When the fever is due to an external pathogen and is mainly a surface condition, like the fever due to colds or flus, it should be treated with a diaphoretic therapy by inducing sweating to open the pores, restore circulation and dispel the chill causing it. However, when the fever is high, in the blood or the interior of the body, heating the liver, when there is much thirst, sweating, inflammation or infection, usually a Pitta condition, then these bitter tonics are more appropriate. Bitter tonics do not merely suppress the fever. They destroy the infection which causes it, catabolizing the pathogen. They attack and destroy the Ama, the toxins which have entered into the tissues and caused the fever. They are thus indicated in any fever due to Ama (which, as in arthritis, may be owing to aggravation of Vata or Kapha). By their light nature they destroy Ama, which is heavy. In reducing heat, acidity and toxicity they cool and detoxify the blood; they also possess an alterative or blood-purifying action.

Their stimulation of Vata also increases Agni–just as wind increases fire. In this regard, they resemble stimulant herbs as well as other herbs possessing actions in both these categories.

Diaphoretics cleanse the lymphatics and the plasma, Ayurvedic Rasa Dhatu. Cooling diaphoretics may also have a cleansing action of the blood. Diaphoretics help cleanse the subtle channels and capillaries. They work primarily on the lungs and the respiratory system. Yet they also help open the mind and breath, increase Prana, clear the sinuses and the senses and stimulate the nervous system. Cooling diaphoretics have additional cleansing action on the liver and blood. 101"

After oil massage, which softens the toxins in the body, it is used to melt them and render them mobile for elimination from the body. Diaphoresis usually is followed by emesis, purgation or enema as prime therapy, but it may sometimes be a prime therapy in itself. Diaphoresis does not require herbs but can be done through fire, steam, exercise, hot baths and so on. The use of herbal diaphoretics should be included with a hot bath, sleeping under a warm blanket and fasting. Typical heating diaphoretics: angelica, basil, bayberry, camphor, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, ephedra (ma huang), eucalyptus, ginger, juniper berries, sage, thyme, wild ginger. Typical cooling diaphoretics: boneset, burdock, catnip, chamomile, chrysanthemum, coriander, elder flowers, horehound, horsetail, peppermint, spearmint, yarrow. DIURETIC HERBS (Mutrata karma) Diuretic herbs increase urination. They promote the functional activity of the kidneys and urinary bladder. Acting on the water element in all the tissue-elements {dhatus) of the body diuretic herbs reduce and remove toxins. Their action is largely one of detoxification and purgation dirough the urine. They are purgatives for the water element in the body and as such they reduce the earth element in the body. Hence, like all purgatives, they must be used with caution. 102"

    "text": "Diuretics decrease water and reduce Kapha, whose main constituent is water. Generally they are bitter, astringent or pungent in taste. Similarly, all diuretics tend to increase the dryness of Vata. This action is aggravated by the tastes that relieve Kapha and dampness. Diuretics also reduce Pitta. Many or even most of them are stronger in reducing Pitta than Kapha. This is not just because Pitta is also somewhat oily in nature. It is because urination is also a way of relieving heat from the body; of removing acid and toxins from the blood; a way of cooling and purifying the blood. This relieves Pitta. Heating and drying herbs, pungent taste, bring water up and out of the body through the process of sweating–diaphoretic action. They also work by relieving mucus through the mouth in expectoration. Just as water evaporates upwards by the action of fire, heating and drying herbs purify our system. Cooling and drying herbs, bitter and astringent tastes–on the other hand–bring water downwards through the urine. Cold herbs cause a descending or contracting action, the way hot herbs create a rising and dispersing action. Diuretic action is generally cooling and drying–the opposite of the qualities of Pitta, heat and moisture. For this reason, diuretics dispel damp heat, as in diarrhea and dysentery, and cool down not only the kidneys and bladder, but also the liver and gall bladder. In increasing urination, they help dispel kidney and bladder stones, and also stones of the gall bladder. Such stone-dispelling herbs are called lithotriptic. 103"

(Facially-accumulated water and water in the head and chest are often better reduced by diaphoretic and expectorant herbs.) They help decrease fat and reduce weight, particularly when fat is mainly composed of water. They stimulate bladder and kidney function, but are seldom actually tonic or nutritive to the kidneys. Their drying action may cause constipation or dryness of the skin. Scanty urination without water accumulation requires a moistening, not a drying therapy, and in that condition, diuretic herbs are usually contraindicated. Vata constitution needs to increase urine by increasing water in the tissues–not a diuretic but a tonic or nutritive therapy. Diuretics are probably the strongest herbs to aggravate Vata, and are contraindicated in conditions of convalescent debility and dehydration. Diuretics can be divided into cooling and heating kinds, the cooling types are in the majority. Cooling diuretics are often also cooling diaphoretics, alteratives or antipyretic herbs, useful in fevers and infectious diseases, particularly those involving the urino-genital tract (as herpes) or the liver and gall bladder. Warming diuretics, like juniper berries, are often warming diaphoretics, stimulants and expectorants and may have antirheumatic action. They are contraindicated in Pitta conditions of kidney or gall bladder inflammation unless they are balanced out by a majority of cooling herbs. 104"

They are mainly pungent in taste and hot in energy, and may also be stimulant, diaphoretic or carminative herbs. (A few, however, like horehound, are bitter in taste and cooling in energy and are particularly good for Pitta.) Others, like licorice, help remove mucus by a moistening action. They increase and liquify Kapha, promoting its flow out of the body. They are mainly sweet and cold herbs. These are also demulcent and emollient herbs, mucilaginous substances that have a softening and soothing effect upon the skin and mucous membranes. Warming and drying expectorants dispel chill and dampness, decrease Kapha and Ama, increase Pitta and Agni, and are particularly good for Kapha or Kapha- Vata type colds and respiratory afflictions. Cooling and moistening expectorants dispel heat and dryness, liquify Kapha and Ama, and work more on Vata or Pitta-Vata type colds and respiratory, afflictions of sore throat or dry, hacking cough. Most expectorants possess cough-relieving action, as coughs are usually caused by mucus blockage or irritation of the respiratory passages.

Cough or cold with yellow phlegm or inflammation of the mucous membranes usually indicates fever or Pitta derangement, damp-heat. Dry cough along with scanty phlegm and chill usually indicates Vata, particularly if it is a chronic condition. Coughs and colds are basically Kapha disorders, as mucus is Kapha and Kapha has as its site the stomach and lungs. Chronic colds and mucous congestion are often relieved by therapeutic vomiting, emetic therapy, a kind of radical expectorant action. Moistening expectorants or demulcents can be used externally to help heal sores, wounds or ulcers. They are nutritive and promote cell growth, as well as being anti-inflammatory. They are the closest category in western herbology to true tonics in the Ayurvedic sense; sweet, nutritive herbs that directly feed and strengthen the organs and tissues. They can be called lung tonics. Some have rejuvenative action. By their softening action, some are laxatives. The soothing action of demulcent herbs gives them a power to help calm the heart and nerves. They are effective nervines in Vata conditions of dehydration and tissue depletion. Demulcent herbs alleviate dryness-caused friction that irritates physiological function. They feed the mucous membranes and the connective tissue. 109"

Chronic constipation, as well as constipation in the elderly, is usually a Vata condition, with its accumulation of gas and dryness in the colon. For this condition, generally mild, moistening or bulk laxatives are prescribed; strong purgatives would cause irritation.

They may also serve as broncho-dilators, stopping spasms in the bronchial tubes, thus proving effective for respiratory afflictions. Others may help relieve menstrual cramping and headaches. Many of these herbs are fragrant, aromatic herbs like mint or valerian.

Aromatic nervines are often also carminative and stomachic herbs, herbs that dispel intestinal gas and cramping. The basis for this can be seen in light of Ayurvedic physiology. Vata, the Dosha that governs the nervous system, accumulates in the colon, from which it invades the tissue-elements of the body. It is also in the colon that the assimilation of nutrients, mainly oils, occurs for the sustenance of nerve and bone tissue. Hence the treatment of Vata in the colon is often a root treatment for Vata in the nervous system; V&ta-relieving herbs can treat both. Generally speaking, in Ayurveda we think of nervousness as Vata or as the mark of a Vata constitution, for Vata governs nerve responses and, by nature as air or wind, it is impulsive, vaccillatory, hypersensitive. Most diseases of the nervous system are diseases of Vata. Hence, in treating nervous disorders, we must first consider Vata. Most nerve pain, lumbago, sciatica, paralysis and degenerative nervous disorders are Vata diseases. Yet many emotional or nervous disorders may be caused by the other Doshas, as those due to anger which would be a Pitta condition. Or Vata may be blocked or aggravated by the other Doshas, in which case an apparant Vata disorder would be due to an underlying excess of Pitta or Kapha. So, again, we must locate primary causes rather than evident effects. Vata-emotions, like fear and anxiety, weaken the kidneys and adrenals.

These are particularly good for both moving and grounding Vata, which suffers from “ungroundedness”–from an excess of air and ether. Such herbs include asafoetida, garlic and valerian. Yet where there is a deficiency of nerve tissues, often due to poor nutrition, nutritive herbs are needed–ashwagattdha or licorice (see tonics).

Pirw-caused nervous disorders can often be treated with general anti-Pitta herbs (see management of Pitta) like bitter tonics or purgatives, without having to resort to any specific nervine herbs at all.

Psychologically, Kapha suffers from greed, desire, attachment, clinging to the past. In terms of the mind and nerves, Kapha requires stimulation. Nervines that are aromatic, stimulant and decongestant are best for Kapha, and most aromatics, by their drying nature, are good for Kapha. Herbs that put Vata or Pitta to sleep may keep Kapha awake–skullcap, for example. Herbs affect different Doshas differently. What sedates one Dosha may stimulate another. Many herbs that calm the mind tend to have a positive effect on all three Doshas, as it is in the balance of the Doshas that the mind is calm. Hence, some nervines may be good for all three Doshas {tridosha herbs), particularly in small amounts or short term usage.

Their action is to increase internal heat, dispel internal chill, and strengthen the metabolism and circulation. They are the most powerful herbs to increase Agni, the digestive fire, and are thereby the strongest herbs to destroy Ama, toxic accumulations. They are synonymous with Agni Dipana and Ama Pachana herbs in Ayurveda; herbs that increase Agni and digest Atna. They contain large amounts of Agni, so that even if the body’s Agni is low, they can still burn away toxins. They warm the stomach, increase the appetite, warm the blood, and stimulate the senses. They often have antibacterial or antiparasitical powers and increase the auto-immune system. They do not actually build up the body, but they allow for the assimilation of food whereby the body can be built up. They are often used widi tonic and nutritive herbs as well as with foods. They are the most powerful herbs to increase Pitta and decrease Kapha. Generally, they decrease Vata, but in excess they can aggravate it through their drying property. 118"

Destroying toxins, they also help relieve fevers, and for this purpose may be combined with bitter tonics and antipyretic herbs. Many stimulant-digestive herbs have carminative and stomachic properties, as they also stimulate peristalsis (samana vayu). Many have diaphoretic properties by heating the surface of the body and promoting sweating. They also increase appetite. Many have expectorant qualities. They help dispel Kapha or mucus from the stomach, lungs and nasal passages, and promote the flow of tears. In promoting circulation, they possess some blood-purifying effects. These digestive stimulants are related to nerve stimulants. They may increase hypertension or cause insomnia. They should be used only to supplement functional weaknesses, not to enable the user to sustain the abuses of excessive activity. Stimulant and digestive herbs are indicated whenever the digestion is to be improved, cold is to be dispelled, toxins and tongue-coating are to be cleared up, and degenerated metabolism and circulation are to be revived. They are contraindicated in conditions of dehydration, fluid insufficiency, and inflammatory conditions of the mucous membranes. They should not be directly applied to the mucous membranes. Typical stimulant herbs: ajwan, asafoetida, black pepper, cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, garlic, ginger (dry), horseradish, mustard, onions, pippali, prickly ash. 119"

Ayurveda considers such herbs as better for promoting digestion of toxins than for promoting normal food digestion. (For such cold, bitter stimulants, see bitter tonic and antipyretic herbs.) TONICS A) Nutritive Tonics (Bruhana karma) The Ayurvedic concept of a tonic is a substance that nurtures the tissue-elements {dhatus) of the body. A nutritive tonic is an herb that nourishes the body and increases weight, density and substance within it. Such herbal foods serve the various dhatus or organs that have been depleted or weakened by disease. Tonics are usually sweet in taste, or in post-digestive effect, which indicates their constructive action. Generally they have the same nature as Kapha and are composed primarily of earth and water. Tonics are usually heavy oily or mucilaginous. They increase vital fluids, muscle and fat and build the blood and lymph, increasing milk and semen. They are restoratives for conditions of weakness, emaciation, debility and convalescence. They have a softening, soothing, harmonizing effect, which dispels rigidity and calms the nerves. 120"

They increase Ama and are not the herbs of choice for Sama conditions, though they can help soften Ama where other more primary herbs facilitate its discharge. Nutritive tonics are moistening and cooling in energy–the best herbs to reduce the dryness of Vata. Yet they are also heavy and are hard to digest. For the low Agni, particularly of Vata constitutions, they are usually combined with various stimulant or carminative herbs (e.g. ginger or cardamom) to aid in their absorption. For Pitta conditions, herbs that combine astringent or bitter with sweet taste, like comfrey root or shatavari, are most appropriate. With their cooling energy, they can be used in convalescence from high fever, toxic blood, ulcers or other inflammatory Pitta conditions. Many of these nutritive tonic herbs possess expectorant, demulcent and emollient action. They soothe and nurture the mucous membranes and restore bodily fluids and secretions. As such, they are particularly nurturing for the mucous membranes of the lungs and stomach. They have a healing action on the skin and may help soften and relieve muscle tension and pain. Ayurveda enhances the nutritive action of herbs with other sweet and nutritive substances like milk, ghee and raw sugar. Typical nutritive tonics: almonds, amalaki, angelica (tang kuei),bala, coconut, comfrey root, dates, flaxseeds, ginseng, 121"

B) Rejuvenative Tonics (Rasayana karma) Ayurvedic herbology reaches its culmination in the science of rejuvenation. Aimed at renewal of both body and mind, Ayurvedic herbology does not seek simply longevity, but moves towards a life of pure awareness, natural creativity spontaneous delight. The approach is not only towards physical immortality (which on some deeper level of harmony may be possible), but the immortality of the mind, the daily renewal of brain cells. In such a state, the mind and heart are as clear in old age as in childhood. This science is called Rasayana. Rasayana is what enters (ayana), in the essence (rasa). It is what penetrates and revitalizes the essence of our psycho-physiological being. Rasayana substances rebuild the body-mind, prevent decay, and postpone aging. They may even help reverse the aging process. They do not simply add to the bulk or quantity of the body, but increase its quality. Rasayana substances are more subtle, more specific, and more lasting than simple nutritive tonics. Their action sustains the optimal form and function of the various organs, dhatus and doshas in the body. They are not necessarily sweet and nutritive, though most are sweet at 122"

Their action is determined as much by prabhava as by the regular rules of taste and energy. According to Ayurveda, plants possess Soma, which is the ambrosia or nectar of immortality. It is also the subtle invigorating fluid, Ojas, the innermost sap of the body. Soma {Ojas) is the basis for clarity of perception, physical strength, endurance, and longevity of the tissues. Soma is the subtle essence-energy of the nervous system, the digested essence of all food, impressions and experiences. As such it is our capacity to enjoy life. It was called “the food of the gods” as in it is the capacity to find delight in all things. The ancient Vedic Science of Rasayana was aimed primarily at the mutation of the brain. It attempted to give a physical basis, the right receptacle, for the birth of true awareness in human beings. By transcending the conditioned functioning of the “old brain,” with its regressive patterns of fear, desire and ambition based on egoistic function, Rasayana performed “miraculous” changes. The real Soma is the purified essence of feeling and sensitivity. Such clarity of awareness is the nectar that feeds and brings about mutation in brain cells.

Brahma (usually called Brahman in English usage) means expansion, and refers to the unbounded expansion that is the creative reality of life. Through meditation, we transcend the limitation of the known, the conditioned functioning of the brain. Typical Rasayanas: For Vata: ashwagandha, calamus, garlic, ginseng, guggul, haritaki.

Vajikaranas reinvigorate the body by reinvigorating the sexual organs. The semen or reproductive tissue (the Ayurvedic concept includes both male and female reproductive tissues) is the essence of all the dhatus, the cream of all the tissue-elements in the body It contains the power to create life. This means not only the capacity to bring a new life into existence, to create a child, but also to renew one’s own life, to return our cells to the vigor of youth. That same life-creating energy, if directed inwards, can aid in the renewal of both body and mind. Vajikarana substances may be used either to improve sexual vitality and functioning, or to help direct sexual energy inwards for regeneration. Most of these are not simple aphrodisiacs–substances exciting sexual activity through irritation of the sexual organs. Many are tonics that actually nurture and give direct sustenance to the reproductive tissues. Others help promote the creative transformation of sexual energy for the benefit of the body-mind. By starting in the reproductive system, these herbs invigorate the entire system, just as a tree is invigorated from the roots. They have a strong revitalizing action on the nerves and bone 125"

Stimulants increase the functional activity of the reproductive organs, while tonics increase and improve the tissue-substance that composes them. Many aphrodisiacs increase Kapha; some which are hot and pungent increase Pitta. Typical aphrodisiacs (Vajikaranas): angelica (tang kuei), asafoetida, ashwagandha, asparagus, cloves, cotton root, damiana, false unicorn, fenugreek, fo-ti, garlic, ginseng, gokshura, hibiscus, lotus seeds, onions (raw), piypali, rehmannia, rose, saffron, saw palmetto, shatavari, Solomon’s seal, vidari-kanda, wild yam.

Such nutritive aphrodisiacs include: angelica (tang kuei), ashwagandha, bah, fo-ti, ghee, ginseng, licorice, lotus seeds, marshmallow, onions (raw), rehmannia, saw palmetto, sesame seeds, shatavari, Solomon’s seal, sugar (raw), vidari-kanda, wild yam. 126"

    "text": "HOW TO PREPARE AND USE HERBS ACCORDING TO AYURVEDA Ayurveda contains many different methods and forms of herbal preparation. All are designed for different therapeutic effects, or to maintain the potencies of herbs in different manners. These include our standard methods of infusions, decoctions, powders, poultices, oils and liniments, but in a greater variety than generally used in western herbalism. They include herbal wines, jellies, resin preparation, pills and tablets. Other special preparations include minerals, metals, ashes, salts, alkalis and sugars. Preparations are accompanied with mantra, yantras, rituals, and fire sacrifices. They are also administered according to certain holy days and along with the phases of the moon and the astrological influences of certain constellations. Confronted with this great abundance, we are limited in our book to the main forms and methods. THE FIVE MAIN METHODS OF HERBAL PREPARATION (Pancha kashaya) Raw herbs are generally prepared according to five basic methods of extraction: the fresh juice of the plant {svarasa); the crushed pulp or paste of the plant {kalka); decoction (kvatha); hot infusion (yhant); and cold infusion (hima). Juice is the strongest; cold infusion the weakest. The rest fall into a descending order of strength. 128"

    "text": "Fresh Juice (Svarasa) The fresh juice of an herb is obtained by taking the fresh plant, crushing or pounding it, then straining the liquid through a cloth. A juicer may also be used for this purpose. This method is not used that often because it relies mainly on freshly picked herbs. Easily available herbs–aloe vera, cilantro, garlic, ginger, lemon, lime, onions, parsley–are also used in the above process, but the effects are best for wild or home grown herbs. For dry herbs, a weaker juice preparation is made by taking the crushed dry herb or powder, adding twice the weight of the herb in water, allowing to set for 24 hours, and then straining the liquid for a juice substitution. Herbal Paste (Kalka) The paste of an herb is obtained by crushing the fresh plant–but only to the point where it becomes a soft mass. It can be done with dried herbs, with the addition of enough water to create a workable paste. Such pastes can be made with honey, ghee or oil, usually in double the amount of the herbs. Various raw sugars can also be used in equal amounts to the herbs. Liquid substances work better with dry herbs, dry substances with fresh herbs. This mode of preparation is often used externally for plasters and poultices to promote the healing of wounds and sores. (Please see section on Herbs for External Usage.) It may also be used as a basis for infusions and decoctions, an herbal 129"

The difference is that a decoction involves boiling the herbs over a low flame, while a hot infusion involves cooking them below the boiling point, or steeping them, bringing them to a boil and then removing them from the heat. The general rule for decoctions: one part dry herbs to sixteen parts water; about half an ounce of herbs per cup or 8 ounces of water. The herbs are then boiled over a low flame until the water is reduced to one quarter of its original amount (for example, four cups would be boiled down to one); the herbs are then strained and the liquid is used as a prepared decoction. This process takes several hours or more and produces a stronger decoction than that usually used in western herbalism. A moderate decoction, requiring less time, can be made by boiling the herbs until half the water is left. A weak decoction takes even less time to prepare since three-quarters of the water is left. The lesser strength of these preparations can be balanced by taking or giving larger dosages. The resultant strong tea is then administered usually with otiher vehicles like honey or hot water (see section on anupanas and section on dosages). 130"

This is possible, particularly when the first decoction is of weak or moderate strengdi. The decoction method is most suitable for roots, stems, bark and fruit–as harder portions of the plant require longer cooking to release their essence. Hot Infusion (Phant) For infusions the ratio of herbs to water is one to eight. For example, one ounce herbs per eight ounce cup of water. In the hot infusion, the herbs are added to boiling water and allowed to set for a period of up to twelve hours. This again is longer than the required time used in western herbalism. Usually thirty minutes of steeping is the minimum required for an infusion. The herbs are then strained and the liquid used. Infusion is better for more delicate plant parts; leaves and flowers, or more herbaceous (non-woody) plants. It is also better for aromatic herbs, like most spices, because boiling destroys and dissipates the aromatic oil. However, many of these herbs can be cooked below the boiling point over a low flame for a long period of time. This may be necessary in formulas that combine root herbs with flowers or leaves; otherwise the more delicate herbs can be added at a later stage of the decoction. 131"

Cold infusion is best for cooling therapy and reducing high Pitta conditions. Such herbs as hibiscus, jasmine, mint and sandalwood are prepared in this manner.

ADDITIONAL METHODS OF HERBAL PREPARATION Milk Decoctions Decoctions can be done with milk as well as water. The classical method was to take one part herbs, eight parts of milk and thirty-two parts water. The mixture was boiled over a low flame until all the water evaporated. For example, one ounce of herbs was used with one cup of milk and four cups of water.

Milk may be used as a sedative and it can be combined with certain herbs like gotu kola or nutmeg to promote sleep. Vessels to Use According to Ayurveda, the best kind of vessel or pot to use for herbal preparations is an earthen pot. Earthenware combines naturally with herbs the same way plants are intrinsically a part of the soil. Ayurveda is not, however, opposed to the use of certain metallic vessels, if their properties are understood. For reducing Kapha, herbs can be prepared in a copper pot because copper has a scraping and reducing action. For Pitta conditions, a pot of brass or silver may be used; these metals are cooling. For Vata, iron may be used as it is heavy and grounding. Aluminum should never be used because it will be absorbed in the body as a poison. Preparing the herbs over a flame, rather than electrical heat, also helps increase their potency and renders them more assimilable to our Agni; wood heat is best.

Another major advantage of powders is that they require a lower dosage than raw herbs (one-quarter to one-half), because they allow more of the herb to be ingested directly. Their disadvantage is that their strength diminishes more rapidly losing potency in six months to one year. How-ever, Ayurvedic powders are prepared by special methods that allow them to last for years. Powders are not taken by themselves, but with a medium (see anuyanas). When ghee, oil, honey or raw sugar are used, they should be twice the amount of the powder. When milk or water is the vehicle, it should be four times the amount of powder.

For example, two ounces of herbs may be used along with one cup of oil and four cups of water, to make one cup of medicated oil. Alternately, one can first make the decoction of herbs by itself. Then equal parts of the decoction and the oil are used, and the mixture is similarly cooked until all the decoction evaporates. This method is helpful where one wishes to not include the herbs in the oil–in which case the decoction is strained before being added to the oil. Some herbs can be added directly to the oil and prepared without water. Aromatic herbs sensitive to heat, like mint, jasmine or camphor, can be added as a powder directly to the oil, one part herbs to four parts oil. The mixture is allowed to stand for 24 to 48 hours, after which it may be strained and is then ready for use. Other not-quite-as-sensitive aromatic herbs, like cayenne, cloves or mustard, can be added directly to the oil, but they should be cooked over a low flame for several hours, then they may be strained and used. Fresh juice of herbs, like garlic or ginger juice, may be added in equal amounts to the oil (as in decoctions), and similarly be cooked until all water evaporates. Special care must be taken not to overboil them. USAGE: Oils may be applied for massage, as ointments for eyes or ears, as dressing for wounds or ulcers, in oil enemas 137"

Anti-Pitta herbs are good in oils for inflammatory conditions of the skin and blood. They are useful in hair loss, premature greying, etc., and may be prepared with coconut oil (which is cooling, while sesame oil is heating). Anti-Vata herbs are good in oils for enemas. Bathing the head in oils {siro-basti, siro-dhara) is good for many problems of the brain and nervous system, as well as for diabetes. Oils as nasya have a similar usage. Internally, they work mainly on Vata and may aggravate Pitta and Kapha. Typical herbs used Ayurvedically in medicated oils: amalaki, asafoet-ida,bala, bkringaraj, calamus, camphor, garlic, ginger, gotu kola, haritaki, jasmine, mint, pippali, saffron, sandalwood, shatavari, turmeric, wild indigo. MEDICATED Ghee (Siddha Ghrita) Medicated ghee is similar to medicated oil. To prepare the ghee itself, heat one pound of raw, unsalted butter on a medium fire for approximately 15 minutes. The butter will melt and start to boil. As it boils, broth will rise to the surface. Do not remove this foam for it contains medicinal properties. Turn the fire to low. The butter will then turn a golden yellow color and will smell rather like popcorn. When a drop or two of water placed in the ghee produces a crackling sound, the ghee is ready.

Ghee enhances Ojas, the subde essence of all tissues. It increases Agni (and all the agnis), and all digestive energies and enzymes of the body. It promotes jatharagni, the digestive fire dwelling in the small intestine, increasing its capacity without aggravating Pitta. It promotes the bhutagnis, the elemental fires which dwell in the liver and govern the transformation of food in the body. It does not clog the liver, as do other oils and fats, but strengthens it. It is food for majja-dhatu, bone marrow and nerve tissue, and feeds the brain. Promoting Ojas, ghee promotes all the subtle tissues of the body, including shukra-dhatu, tire reproductive tissues. Through Ojas it gives sustenance to Tejas, the fire of the mind, and thus promotes medhagni, the flame of intelligence and perception. As such, it is an important rejuvena-tive tonic or rasayana for the mind, the brain and the nervous system. It is good for Vata and Pitta doshas. For Pitta disorders ghee is prepared wiffi bitter herbs. It is similarly prepared for fever, for which ghee is said to be the best medicine. Ghee is excellent for diseases of the subtle tissues, nerves and mind, including many Vata problems. It is usually taken internally and is often used as nasya. “Typical herbs prepared in ghee: bitter herbs generally amalaki, ash-wagandha, bhringaraj, calamus, 139"

MEDIA OF INTAKE (Anupana) In Ayurveda, herbal medicines are prescribed to be taken with various mediums of intake, as hot water or milk. Such vehicles for taking herbs are called anupanas. Anupanas may enhance the therapeutic effects of herbs. For instance, dry ginger given with honey increases its power of expectoration. Anupanas may relieve the side-effects of herbs, as when hot spices are given with milk to lessen the aggravation of Pitta. They may serve as flavoring agents to make medicines palatable. They are used much like supplementary herbs in the formulas themselves. They can also serve as catalytic agents, or yogavahis, to help direct the effects of the herbs to the deeper and subtler tissues of the body. This is the case when ghee is used as an anupana. Anupanas may change the dosha the herbs work on. Ghee is the strongest substance in helping herbs reduce Pitta and fever; sesame oil for the reduction of Vata; and honey for the reduction of Kapha. The same medicine taken with ghee may reduce Pitta, but with honey may target Kapha. The simplest way to use anupanas is with hot and cold water. Hot water is best for herbs to reduce Vata and Kapha. Cold water is best to reduce Pitta. 140"

    "text": "However, fever-reducing herbs should always be taken with hot water. Cold water and cold food are contraindicated during fever. It is the suppression of the central digestive fire that causes fever by spreading its heat to the surface of the body. Intake of cold substances supresses it further. Thirst and desire for cold drinks during fever should be relieved by cold sponge baths and warm teas. Water conveys the effects of herbs to rasa, the plasma. Honey brings them to the blood and the muscles. Milk brings them to the plasma and blood. Alcohol brings them to the subtle tissue, to the nerves. Raw sugar can be used as an anupana also. It increases the tonic effect of herbs, much like milk does. It tonifies plasma and blood, relieves heat and protects the tissues, aiding in metabolism. Typical anupanas include: cold water, hot water, honey, ghee, butter, raw sugar, herbal decoctions or infusions (like ginger or mint tea), fruit juices, meat soup. HERBS FOR EXTERNAL USAGE Many herbs have value in external usage–in washes, pastes, poultices and oils. These herbs can be spoken of as vulneraries, for promoting healing of sores or wounds. It is important that we differentiate their functions and their appropriate times of usage. Many astringents are famous as vulneraries (see astringent herbs). This is because they promote the knitting of tissues by drying and contracting action. They also have 141"

This is largely because they have a soothing and softening effect upon the skin and provide nourishment to damaged tissues. Again, they have some anti-inflammatory effects by their cooling energy. Many bitter herbs are used externally. This is because of their strong anti-inflammatory action, their very cold nature, their refrigerant action on burns, their antiseptic or antibacterial action, and their power to reduce fever. A lot of pungent herbs are used externally because they promote local circulation, ripen boils and promote suppuration. They also provide a counter-irritant action that may be analgesic. In the initial, acute and often febrile phase of a sore or wound, bitter herbs are most appropriate. When the fever is down and pus formation has begun, pungent herbs are more appropriate. When healing has begun and most pus has been dispelled, astringent (and later sweet) herbs can be used to finalize the healing process. Chronic sores that do not heal may first require the application of pungent herbs to increase local circulation. Herbs for internal usage in these conditions will be largely the same as those for external usage. Pungent herbs may be irritating to open sores and to mucous membranes. They are often effective as pastes for relieving pain and headaches. Herbs for external usage: chickweed, comfrey flaxseed, Irish moss, licorice, marshmallow, plantain, self-heal, slippery elm, 142"

ROUTES OF ADMINISTRATION The main route of administration for herbal medicines is through the mouth. Yet other places have their special value. ENEMA TREATMENT: When the dosha, particularly Vata, is accumulated in the colon, rectal administration is the preferred route, with medicated enemas (basti). Pungent herbs can be taken this way to clear congestion, mucus and ama from the colon. Oils and sweet, moistening herbs can be taken for their lubricating action or for their nutritive effects. Sweet, astringent and bitter herbs can be taken this way for inflammation or ulcerative conditions of the colon. Diuretic herbs can be taken this way. Because of their proximity to the kidneys in enema usage, diuretic herbs can have a very direct effect. Nasal Administration/Smoking of Herbs Problems relating to Prana, to the nervous and respiratory systems, are often best treated through nasal administration (nasya), which includes application of oil to the ears. Snuffing of powders, application of oil to nasal membranes, inhalation of vapors/incense, and taking liquid preparations through the nose to clear the sinuses, are all ways of nasal application. 143"

Nervines (like gotu kola) may be taken this way, particularly as a medicated ghee, (taken in 5 drops in each nostril, lying down), for direct action on the brain. Also included in nasal administration is the smoking of herbs. Herbs are often smoked as part of detoxification therapy (after pancha karma) to burn residual toxins from the system. Herbs may also be used in the place of tobacco to help stop smoking. Smoking of herbs helps enhance their decongestant and anti-cough action and is good for colds and sore throats. It gives them immediate action on the nerves and may help clear the mind for yoga and meditation. Herbs for smoking: ajwan, bayberry, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, cubebs, ginger (mainly hot, pungent, expectorants) and such special rejuvenatives for the mind as calamus and gotu kola. Eye Administration Problems relating to vyana, the vata that governs muscular movement and the circulatory system, may be treated through herbal medicines applied to the eyes (anjana). Herbs to restore a patient to consciousness can be given this way, as well as herbs for local eye problems. Under this are also included eye drops, oils for the eyes, and ointments applied in and around the eyes. 144"

    "text": "Skin Administration Application of herbs and oils to the skin is another major route. This is helpful not only for local skin problems, but can help in many other conditions, including different Vata disorders, weakness of the lungs and the nervous system. Massage with herbal oils is one of the best means of reducing high Vata. Special oil administration may involve the use of ghee or sesame oil on the sites of the seven chakras, either on the back or the front of the body. For example, high Pitta can often be reduced by the application of sandalwood oil at the site of the third eye. Like Chinese medicine, Ayurveda recognizes the value of heating special meridian points on the body. Called moxibustion in the Chinese system, it is called Agni karma, fire-treatment, in Ayurveda. Ayurveda uses turmeric, calamus, or metallic rods, usually copper or silver, heated and superficially applied to vital points or chakras. This helps burn toxins and stimulate organ function. The herbs may be made into a cigarette and burned about half an inch above the points to be treated, until they become hot. TIMES OF ADMINISTRATION Ayurveda recognizes that the times of taking herbs are important in strengthening their effects. 145"

Herbs taken with the meal tend to work on the stomach and small intestine, on the middle part of the body and samana vayu, the air governing digestive functions. And herbs taken after meals tend to work on the lungs, on the upper part of the body and on yrana vayu, the air governing respiratory functions. Herbs that tend to work on the lower part of the body such as purgatives, diuretics and emmenagogues, and herbs targeting the colon, the kidneys or the reproductive organs, should be taken before meals. Herbs working on digestive functions (stimulants and carminatives, bitter tonics, or nutritive tonics, which are taken like food), and herbs that target the stomach, spleen, liver or small intestine, should be taken with meals. Herbs that tend to work on the upper part of the body–diaphoretics, expectorants, nervines–and herbs that target the lungs, heart or brain, should be taken after meals. Other times of administration are discriminated Rejuvenatives are often taken first thing in the morning, as are herbs that reduce Kapha and mucus. Strong purgatives may be taken first thing in the morning for those who rise early, or just before sleep for those who have to be at work early in the morning. 146"

At meals, a little of an herb may be taken with every morsel of food. This works with strong medications, for those who have difficulty getting herbs down, and when using herbs (hot spices) that increase Agni. Herbs may be taken between meals to help in the increase of metabolism. Herbs can also be taken moment by moment, for acute conditions like Prana disturbances of asthma, vomiting and hiccough. Generally speaking, strong medicines are given during acute attacks and weaker medication between attacks, and for chronic conditions. COMPOUNDS In Ayurveda, herbs are generally not used alone but in compounds. Ayurveda holds that the right combination of herbs gready increases their healing powers, helps expand the field of their activity and compensates for their side effects. To the understanding of the qualities of individual herbs should be added the art of combining them, the Ayurvedic yoga of their usage. There are laws and principles in constructing compounds through which they can be formulated and understood. 147"

    "text": "In combining herbs, first of all it is necessary to select an individual herb that best represents the healing actions most appropriate for the individual person and his or her condition, as with a prime diaphoretic like bayberry to treat the common cold. To this should be added herbs of similar properties. The main principle behind all compounds is diat herbs of similar properties enhance each other. An equal amount of a combination of similar herbs has a stronger therapeutic effect than the same amount of any one herb by itself. For example, in the compound trikatu, consisting of dry ginger, black pepper and fripyali (Indian long pepper), in which all three herbs promote digestion and assimilation, 500 mg of this compound has a much stronger effect than 500 mg. of any single one of these herbs. Herbs often have more than one action. Which will be their main action will depend upon the herbs with which they are combined. For example, combined with diaphoretic herbs like bayberry or ephedra, the diaphoretic action of cinnamon is activated and enhanced. Combined with digestive agents like cardamom or bay leaves, it will have an action more on that level. Apart from a few herbs that share the main action of the primary herb in a formula, a few herbs which share related actions may be added as assistants. In a diaphoretic or sweating formula to relieve a cold or flu, some other herbs may be added for such related problems as cough or to dispel mucus. 148"

    "text": "Besides this synergistic action of similar herbs there is the antidotal action of contrary herbs. Often a formula may contain an herb or two whose action is opposite that of the majority of herbs contained in it. Such antidotal herbs serve to balance out the formula and prevent it from having too excessive or one-sided an action. They alleviate potential side-effects and may have a protective action on the tissues. Formulas that contain very hot herbs like cloves or pippah, according to this principle, may also contain some raw sugar or rock candy. This has an opposite cooling property, which makes them easier to take. In formulas that aim at purification some tonic herbs may be included for their protective action. In formulas that aim at tonification, some light digestive herbs may be included to counter their tendency by their heaviness, to weaken digestion. In addition to these major herbs in a formula, some other herbs may be added in small dosages to facilitate their usage by the body. Compounds may contain some stimulant herbs to aid in the absorption and assimilation of the other herbs in the formulas. In western herbalism, cayenne pepper is generally used in this capacity or sometimes dry ginger. In Ayurveda, the compound trikatu is usually used. Such substances are called prakshepa dravyas, or means of energization. More developed formulas may contain five or more of these substances, but their dosage is small enough so that they insure the main herbs are properly digested without changing their action. 149"

    "text": "becomes a conscious act, and thereby a means of healing consciousness. Mantra is not merely a matter of mechanically repeating various powerful sounds. Mantra also implies meditation. Meditation (dhyana), means receptivity, passive awareness, in which there is the unity of the seer and the seen. It means understanding, the attitude of openness in which there is space for the inner truth to manifest itself. This inner truth that comes from all things in meditation is itself the mantra. The true power of mantra appears in meditation. The right use of mantra implies establishing the healing space of meditation. Plants meditate. The earth meditates. The sun vibrates the great mantra Om as it moves in the sky. All of nature is the creative meditation of the cosmic spirit. The basic silence and peace of nature is meditation. It is much too complicated here to discuss specific mantras, which relate to specific therapies, but there is one great mantra through which all herbal preparations can be energized. It is the great mantra of the Goddess. The Goddess (Devi) is the Shakti, the divine energy working in nature, through which all healing, integration and evolution proceed. She, the Divine Mother, prepares the right food and medicine for all life forms. It is only through her that our food and medicine has nourishing and healing power. Therefore, giving power to her in the mantra energizes all things accordingly. 156"

    "text": "This mantra is OM AIM HRIM KLIM CHAMUNDAYAI VICCHE (pronounced om aim hreem kling chamoondayee vichay). It is the mantra to the Goddess Chamunda, who integrates within herself the three great Goddesses of Saraswati, Durga and Kali, along with their three elements of air, fire and water (Vata, Pitta and Kapha), and their three centers of the head, the navel, and the base of the spine. Doing this mantra 108 times while preparing herbal medicines, or upon taking them, will give them a gready increased potency. Originally Ayurvedic medicines were prepared with a mantra. Just as food should be prepared with love to be really nourishing, so herbs should be prepared with a mantra. It is not what we prepare, but how we prepare it. All healing practices should flow from the love and the awareness of a mantra. Along with mantra comes yantra. Mantra is the seed-syllable of the cosmic creative vibration; yantra is the pattern it creates, its energy field. Mantra is the name of the deity; yantra is the subde form, yantras are mystic diagrams, geometrical designs that manifest cosmic law (which, in more complicated designs, become mandalas). Yantras a it drawn on silk, on the bark of certain trees, on copper and on gold (copper is usually best for most purposes). Ayurvedic medicines are often prepared with yantras or in the presence of a yantra. yantras, which are largely composed of triangular or pyramid shapes, serve to draw in the cosmic life force and establish a space for healing to occur. With the mantra they purify the astral aura and cleanse the psychic environment, which is always impure or stagnant in the case of disease. 157"

We have illustrated the Shri yantra, which is the king of the yantras, the great yantra of the goddess that represents and contains within itself the entire universe. This yantra goes with the mantra to the goddess and can be used generally for all forms of healing and preparation of herbs. 158"

    "text": "HERBS FOR AYURVEDIC USAGE The first section of our herb list consists of typical western herbs and their Ayurvedic usage. Emphasis has been on herbs used both in India as well as the west, and so a number of common spices have been selected. The attempt has been to include a variety of herbs in different categories. Owing to the limitation of space, other valuable herbs could not be so explicated. These are given, with their more basic indication, in the appendix. The first name of the herb is its English or most commonly known name. Second is the Latin name and plant family. Third is the Sanskrit (S) name and fourth is the Chinese (C) name, when available. Energetics are taste (rasa), energy (virya), and post-digestive effect (vipaka). V is Vata, P is Pitta, K is Kapha; + or- are increases or decreases. VPK = is balancing to all three doshas. Ama is toxins. Tissues are the Ayurvedic dhatus; systems relate to the Ayurvedic srotas. The second section consists of some major oriental herbs. It includes important Indian herbs not commonly known here yet (a few are available through Indian markets). It also includes some Chinese herbs, like ginseng, that are becoming popular here and may be used like Ayurvedic tonics, particularly when the latter are not available. Some of the herbs in this section are used both in Indian and Chinese 159"

Only a few major ones have been given by way of example. Tastes, when multiple, and actions, are usually in descending order of strength. Dosage and preparation of herbs will generally be according to our section on dosage. The more specific dosages given for individual herbs will be based on common usage. Powders of all herbs can be prepared as infusions. (Decoctions are for harder and heavier raw herbs, like most roots.) Indications of conditions treated by the herbs are suggestive rather than exhaustive. Precautions are not necessarily contraindications. The same disease condition may occur in different forms and so require different treatment and have different contraindications. Ayurvedic treatment is to cleanse the body of Ama, balance the constitution and promote rejuvenation. It does not treat diseases as specific entities but as by-products of aggravated doshas. A.

It contains organic minerals like calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium, and almost all known vitamins. It is also very high in chlorophyll. As such, it combines well with other natural supplements like dandelion, horsetail, nettles and parsley. However, it is not entirely tonic or nutritive in the Ayurvedic sense, for by itself it does not really provide substance for building tissue. Its action is cleansing and detoxifying. It has a drying effect that may aggravate Vata, increasing emaciation. For such individuals, it is best taken occasionally or as balanced out by more nutritive tonics. It is a mild blood purifier and a good general beverage for Pitta (and also, to a lesser degree, Kapha) constitutions. 161"

Aloe regulates sugar and fat metabolism and tonifies all the agnis, the digestive enzymes of the body; and at the same time it reduces Pitta. It is rejuvenative for Pitta and for the uterus. Two teaspoons of it can be taken three times a day with a pinch of turmeric, as a general tonic. It is more palatable mixed with water or apple juice. Or three ounces of the gel can be taken from a fresh plant along with three ounces of water, three teaspoons of salt, brought to a boil and combined with one ounce of raw sugar and taken in teaspoonful doses. Commercial aloe juices are often diluted and combined with other additives that may give them a different effect. As a nutritive tonic, aloe can be combined with shatavari, as a bitter tonic with gentian, and as an alterative and emmenagogue with man-jishta. The fresh juice can be applied externally for burns, sores, herpes, etc. Aloe powder is a powerful laxative that must be used in small amounts. The powder’s taste is nauseating and so it should be taken in capsules. The powder can also cause severe griping and should be taken with a carminative herb like turmeric or rose flowers. 163"

It is a strong stimulant, both circulatory and digestive, and a strong dispeller of internal and external cold. It is food for Agni. However, cayenne can aggravate inflammatory conditions in the body. Although it is not to be used indiscriminately, it does enhance the properties of many other herbs. Cayenne has strong hemostatic action and can be used in acute condition to stop bleeding. However, long term usage of cayenne can promote hemorrhaging by its heating property. It is helpful in cases of heart weakness or heart attack for revival purposes, but it can also aggravate high Pitta, which causes some heart attacks. Cayenne can be used with other herbs wherever stimulant action is required. It is particularly effective in burning toxins from the colon. It has similar properties to black pepper but is stronger in short term usage and weaker in long term effect. Its quality is rajasic and so it may increase disturbance in the mind if used too much.

They have a special action on the heart, strengthening the heart muscle and promoting longevity. They are particularly good for Vata heart conditions like nervous palpitation, or the heart problems of old age (the age of Vata) like cholesterol and arteriosclerosis. In promoting digestion they help remove accumulated food masses or even tumors in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet tihey can help increase weight in the body and may aggravate Kapha in excess. They will also aggravate most Pitta heart conditions and heat conditions in the body generally. They can be prepared as a tincture or herbal wine–they have an affinity for alcohol. For strengthening the heart muscles, they can be used with other heart tonics like small amounts of cardamom and cinnamon. One-half ounce of hawthorn berries can be simmered in one pint of water for 20 minutes along with one teaspoon of cinnamon and taken three times a day after meals, sweetened with honey as a heart tonic.

The rootbark is a strong anthelmintic, taken as a decoction with a little cloves, followed by a purgative every second or third day to dispel the worms (such treatment may continue for 10 days or more). The fruitrind is better for usage as an astringent and anti-inflammatory herb for the mucous membranes. The fresh juice has stronger tonic properties, particularly for the blood and for Pitta. The fruit rind powder may be used as a douche for leucorrhea; the paste can be used externally for sores, ulcers, hemorrhoids. The juice is good for promoting digestion and all parts have stomachic properties, which can be augmented with small amounts of cinnamon and cloves.

They are a good astringent for the intestines, possessing carminative and stomachic properties, thus also increasing Agni while promoting absorption. They are effective for nervous digestive disorders of children or of high Vata types. They strengthen the villi of the small intestine. As a spice, they are antidotal to the gas-producing properties of legumes. Their quality is tamasic. They induce sleep and, in long term usage, dull the mind and so may inhibit awareness, though they do help bring down high Vata psychological imbalances. As a nervine they may be used with valerian. One-quarter ounce of poppy seeds can be simmered in one pint of water along with one teaspoon each of nutmeg and ginger powder and taken three times a day immediately after meals for nervous digestion. A cup may also be taken before sleep to promote rest. PRICKLY ASHXanthoxylum spy.; Rutaceae 219"

They may be replaced with psyllium husks, which are a superior medicinal, or balanced by an aromatic like ginger or fennel. The heavy property of psyllium tends to reduce Agni, and so for long term usage balancing it out with a digestive stimulant would be recommended anyway. Psyllium can be taken in buttermilk in case of diarrhea, and in warm milk in case of constipation.

As such, it is often wise to combine it with small amounts of spices such as cinnamon, cloves or ginger, or to sweeten it with honey. As a tonic, it can be decocted in milk, or with comfrey root and small amounts of licorice. For ulceration and hyperacidity, it can be used with small amounts of bitter stomachics, like gentian. Externally, the paste can be used to soothe burns, relieve inflammation and heal damaged tissue.

It is tonic to Kapha, to the lungs; it improves voice, vision, and promotes the growth of hair. It is both strongly laxative and strongly astringent, cleansing the bowels and increasing their tone. Bibhitaki is effective for all manner of stones and Kapha accumulations in the digestive, urinary and respiratory tract; it liquifies and expels them, including removal of parasites. It astringes and tones the stomach and increases appetite. Though it is heating in energy, it does not aggravate Pitta. As a powder mixed with honey, it can be taken for sore throat and impaired voice; it may also be used as a gargle. Used externally, it is an antiseptic.

The raw form is used for clearing deep-seated fevers and is thought to be cooling in energy. The cooked form is used for most tonic purposes and is thought to be slightly warming. In terms of Ayurveda, Rehmannia is Kapha in nature; it increases bodily tissues, fluids and secretions. Both kinds, raw and cooked, decrease Pitta and treat such Pitta disorders as anemia. Cooked rehmannia is a good substitute for shatavari as a tonic and rejuvenative for the uterus. Cooked rehmannia is a major herb for the problems of aging and helps counter dryness and lack of vitality of high Vata conditions. Yet it is somewhat greasy and may need to be given along with digestion-increasing herbs like cinnamon or ginseng, so that it does not cause diarrhea.

In fact, it is thought to have stronger properties in this regard. It has been called an “Indian ginseng.” PUERARIA, the kudzu plant (Pueraria tuberosa), is used as a substitute for arrowroot and is a common weed (an invasive vine) in the southern United States.

Other herbs that may be used as beverages should similarly be related according to constitution and condition so that their real effectiveness can manifest. This is not to recommend all these herbs for general usage as beverages. Any herb you wish to take as a common beverage should be taken in low dosages and examined for possible long term effects.

    "text": "for Yogis and improves meditation. A small amount of the fresh leaves are eaten daily for rejuvenating the mind. Brahmi helps awaken the crown chakra and balance the right and left hemispheres of the brain. It calms the heart and helps guard against heart attacks. Brahmi helps us give up bad habits and addictions of all types. It aids in recovery from alcholism or drug abuse, and also helps us kick the sugar habit. For this reason it is added to many Ayurvedic formulas as a nervine and antispasmodic agent. It is cleansing to the blood, improves the immune system, allays excess sexual desire, and is excellent for venereal diseases, including AIDS. It cleanses the kidneys, while calming and soothing the liver. Brahmi is one of the best herbs for balancing and rejuvenating Pitta, while at the same time strongly reducing Kapha. It can reduce Vata if taken in the proper dose or with other anti-Vata herbs, like Ashwagandha. A cup of Brahmi tea taken with honey before meditation is a great aid in the practice. As a milk decoction the herb is a good brain tonic, particularly if combined with Ashwagandha. Taken with basil and a little black pepper Brahmi is good for all kinds of fevers. As a rejuvenative it is best prepared in ghee. Brahmi ghee is an important medicine for the mind and heart that should be kept in every home. There are several botanical controversies about Brahmi. First is the identity of Brahmi and a similarly used plant called Manduka Pami (Bacopa), which however is unrelated botanically. Generally the Brahmi (Hydrocotyle) is the preferable agent. Ayurveda, like many traditional systems, has emphasized using equivalent herbs because the same 351"

The other controversy is about the identity of Brahmi and Gotu Kola. The two herbs are closely related botanically and possess similar properties (though Gotu Kola is a stronger diurectic and a weaker nervine). By recent accounts Gotu Kola is Centella Asiatica and so some Ayurvedic doctors do not like to simply identify the two. Because Gotu Kola is more readily available than Brahmi from India, and is not much different in properties, it is often used in its place.

Its hot nature is anti-Ama, not Pitta aggravating and destroys toxins without aggravating heat or fire in the body. Guduchi, like Ashwagandha and Shatavari, is an excellent tonic for the immune system, and therefore one of the best herbs for poor immune function. It is particularly important for countering chronic low grade fevers or difficult to treat infections from Epstein bar virus to AIDS, such as many people today suffer from. It increases our positive energy in conditions of debility like chronic fatigue syndrome. The bitter starch which comes from the plant, called Guduchi or Giloy Sattva is the best way to take it. Taken with ghee Guduchi reduces Vata, with sugar it reduces Pitta, and with honey it reduces Kapha. The Chinese use the herb mainly for swelling owing to arthritis or traumatic injury.
